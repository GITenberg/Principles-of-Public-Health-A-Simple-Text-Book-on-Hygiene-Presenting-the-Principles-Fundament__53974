<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION</a></h2>


<p>The earliest history of remote ages describes methods
employed in combating disease, and down through all the
centuries the struggle against infection has been going on.
The science of health as applied in recent years reveals
wonderful progress in the avoidance of disease, and in the
control of the violent epidemics by which in the past nations
were almost exterminated. Modern methods of hygiene
and sanitation as applied to public health have robbed
smallpox and diphtheria of their death-dealing power;
cholera and yellow fever have been forced to retreat before
the victorious hosts of applied medical science; tuberculosis,
the greatest foe of human life, is slowly but surely receding
before the determined efforts of modern preventive medicine.</p>

<p>By nature man is endowed with resistive power sufficient
to ward off most forms of disease, provided he keeps his
health at a normal standard by right living. If, however,
he allows his health to become impaired by reason of overwork,
bad habits, wilful exposure to contagion or unhealthful
surroundings, he readily falls a prey to disease.</p>

<p>The author of <cite>Principles of Public Health</cite> has here set
forth the general rules of life by the observance of which
every adult and every child not only can do much to preserve
his own health but also can prove himself a prominent
factor in raising the standard of public health. A campaign
of education is demanded to arrest the enormous loss of
life which is carrying so many to untimely graves, and the
instruction given in this volume will be of inestimable
value in teaching people how to avoid avoidable disease.</p>

<p>The author has not attempted to deal with all the diseases
that may be classed as preventable; as the work is
intended for use in the public schools, only such diseases
are mentioned as it seems fitting to present to school
children. To teach our children a proper respect for their
own health and for the community welfare is to fit them for
the best citizenship.</p>

<span class="small bold">CONSTANT DANGER OF ILLNESS</span></h3>


<p>Every boy and girl confidently expects to grow into a
strong and healthy man or woman. How often we hear
a child say, "When I am a man," or "When I am a
woman;" but I have never heard a boy or a girl say, "If
I live to be a man or woman." When you think of what
you will do when you are grown into men or women, it
never occurs to you that you may be weak and sickly and
therefore not able to do the very things that you would
most like to do. This suggests that sickness is not natural,
else the thought that you may perhaps become sick would
enter your mind. As a matter of fact, most sickness is not
natural.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The fight for
life</div>

<p>There is a constant struggle going on in the world.
You see a fight about you every day among the animals.
You see the spider catch the fly, the snake catch the
frog, the bird catch the insect, and the big fish catch
the minnow; and you have heard of wars where men kill
one another.</p>

<p>The greatest enemies that men have to fight, however,
are not other men, or wild animals, but foes that kill
more men, women and children every year than were
ever killed in the same length of time by war. These
foes are small, very small, but you must not think that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
because things are small they are not dangerous. We call
these foes <em>disease germs</em>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The nature
of a germ</div>

<p>The germ is a very, very small body; it is the smallest
living body that we know. Later we shall learn that our
bodies are made up of cells, and that these cells are extremely
small&mdash;so small that it takes a very powerful
microscope to see one of them. The germ is still smaller
than the cells in our bodies, and it is made of a single cell.
There are a great many kinds of germs in the world.
Fortunately, most of them are not harmful. Some germs
cause disease, but there are other germs that not only are
not harmful, but are actually helpful to men. Among
the helpful germs are those that enrich the ground, and
these should be protected; but all germs that cause disease
should be destroyed as rapidly as possible. These germs
are fighting all the time against our health. They are not
armed with guns and cannon, neither do they build forts
from which to fight; but they get inside our bodies and
attack us there.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">How to fight
germs</div>

<p>There are three principal ways by which we fight
disease germs: <em>first</em>, by keeping our bodies so well and
strong that germs cannot live in them; <em>second</em>, by keeping
germs out of our bodies; <em>third</em>, by preventing germs
from accumulating in the world&mdash;that is, by killing as
many of them as possible.</p>

<p>If it is possible to keep so well and strong that disease
germs cannot live in our bodies, you will naturally infer
that there are other causes of sickness besides disease
germs. That is true, for there are a great many things
beside germs that cause our bodies to get into such a condition
that disease germs can enter and grow and make
us ill. We sometimes call this a "run-down" condition.
Before we begin, then, to study the germs that cause
disease, we must learn how to keep our bodies strong and
ready to fight these germs.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><b>Questions.</b> 1. What evidence have we that sickness is not
natural? 2. Name some of the fights going on in the animal
world. 3. What can you say of the amount of illness caused
by germs? 4. Tell what you have learned about germs.
5. Name three ways of fighting germs.</p>

<p><b>Remember.</b> 1. Most sickness comes from failure to observe
Nature's laws. 2. We must keep up a constant fight against
germs that cause sickness. 3. We fight germs by killing as
many of them as we can, and by keeping our bodies so strong
that if a disease germ enters it cannot grow.</p></div>

<span class="small bold">THE NECESSITY OF CARING FOR THE BODY</span></h3>


<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/figure003.jpg" width="600" alt="" />
<div class="cap-center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 3.</span> The organs of the body.</div>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">How the
body is like
an automobile</div>

<p>These bodies of ours are built somewhat like automobiles.
An automobile is made up of a framework, wheels,
body, gasoline tank, engine, and steering-gear. The
human body has much the same form of construction.
We have a frame, which is made of the bones of the body.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
We have arms and legs, which correspond to the wheels of
the automobile. We have many little pockets in our bodies
in which fat is stored, and these little pockets answer to
the gasoline tank of the automobile. We have an engine
which, like the automobile engine, is made up of many
parts; and we have a head or brain, that plays the same
part as the steering-gear of the automobile.</p>

<p>The automobile has a tank in which is carried the gasoline
necessary to develop power for the machine. If the
gasoline gives out, the engine will not run, and before
the owner starts on a trip, he is always careful to see that
the tank is well filled. In the same way, if we do not
provide new fat for the pockets in our bodies in which the
fat is stored, our supply will soon give out and our bodies
will refuse to work, just as the engine of the automobile
will refuse to work when the gasoline is used up.</p>

<div class="sidenote">What cells
are like</div>

<p>The automobile is made of iron and wood and rubber,
and each bit of iron and wood and rubber is made up of
tiny particles. The body is made of bones and muscles,
covered with skin, and all these are made up of very
fine particles that we call cells. Every part of the body
is made of these fine cells. The cells are so small that
they can be seen only with a powerful microscope. If
you look at your hand you cannot see a cell, because it
takes a great many cells to make a spot large enough for
you to see. In Figure 1 you see a boy looking through a
microscope, and beside him you see a picture of what he
sees. This picture does not look like the skin on your
hand, neither does it look like the skin on the boy's hand;
but it is nothing more nor less than a piece of skin taken
from that boy's hand, and it looks just as a piece of skin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
from your own hand would look if you were to see it
through a very strong microscope.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Why cells
must not be
killed</div>

<p>The whole body is made up of just such little cells as
you see in Figure 4, and each cell is alive and has a
certain work to perform. It is very important that we
keep these cells from dying and that they perform the
work for which they are intended, for if these cells die
or fail to act, the body becomes sick or dies.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 25%;">

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 4.</span> A cell.
(a) Cell body; (b) nucleus; (c) nucleolus.</div>
</div>

<p>You can scratch some of the paint from your automobile
and the machine will work just as well as ever.
Apparently no harm has been done, but
an opening has been made through which
moisture and germs can enter and cause
the wood to rot and the iron to rust. You
can remove certain parts of the automobile
and still the machine will do its work; but
you cannot take away too much of any
one part without weakening the automobile,
and if certain parts are missing (such
as the sparker, the battery, or the steering-gear),
the usefulness of the machine is destroyed. So it
is with the body. You can scratch off some of the skin
and not do any apparent harm, but you have made an
opening through which germs may get into the body.
You can remove certain parts of the body, such as the
arm or leg, and still the body will do efficient service.
But there are certain parts of the body that are necessary
to life, just as certain parts of the automobile are
necessary to the usefulness of the machine. You cannot
remove the heart and live; you cannot remove the brain
and live.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">How cells
are killed</div>

<p>You are probably thinking that it must be easy to kill
such a little thing as a cell; and so it is. Cells can be
killed by too much heat or too much cold. When you
skin your hand, you kill many cells, and at the same time
make an opening for germs to get in and cause sickness.
You can kill cells also by starving them, for they must
have not only enough food, but the right kind of food.
If you feed your bodies on nothing but candy, pie, and
cake, most of the cells will refuse to perform their work
and many of them will die. These cells must have also
an abundance of air, and the air must be pure and fresh.
If you breathe the air that others have breathed or that
contains poison of any kind, you will soon find that you
are not feeling well. This simply means that so many of
the cells are being starved for fresh air, that not enough
strong ones are left to do the necessary work. You can
kill these cells by overwork, for they must have a proper
amount of rest. If you go to school all day long and then
sit up until midnight every night, you must not expect
the cells of your body to keep strong and well. You
can kill these cells by the use of certain things that
act as poisons to them, such as tobacco, beer, wine, or
whisky.</p>

<div class="cap-center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 5.</span> Warm, dry clothing necessary for health.</div>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">Why the
body should
be equally
covered</div>

<p>The body should always be kept at as nearly uniform
a temperature as possible. In order to do this we wear
clothing. Clothing keeps out the heat on a hot day, just
as it keeps the heat in and the cold out on a cold day.
The clothing should be equally heavy on all parts of the
body. It is not right to wear a thick dress over your
chest and leave your shoulders and arms bare, or nearly
so. People who do this are killing a great many cells by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
letting part of their bodies become chilled while the rest
is warm, probably too warm.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Why clothing
should
not be too
heavy</div>

<p>The clothing should be just heavy enough to keep the
body warm. If you wear such heavy clothing indoors
that you are constantly perspiring, your underclothes become
damp, and when you go out, even though you put
on your overcoat, your body becomes chilled. If you
begin to sneeze, that is Nature's way of telling you that
you are killing many of your cells by too much cold.</p>

<p>People sometimes get warm from exercising, and then
take off their coats. They should have removed their
coats before they began to exercise. If you take off your
coat after you are too warm, your body becomes chilled.
Baseball pitchers know this, and if you watch a good
pitcher, you will see that he always puts on his sweater
as soon as he stops pitching, even though he is very
warm. He knows that if he cools off too quickly, he will
become stiff and sore and cannot pitch good ball.</p>

<div class="sidenote">When a
draft is
dangerous</div>

<p>Sometimes a person sits in a warm room until he begins
to perspire freely. Then he opens a window and sits
in the draft. Under ordinary conditions, the cool wind
alone would chill the body, but now the rapid drying of
the perspiration makes the body cool still more quickly.
The sudden chill causes the person to take cold, which is
simply another way of saying that he has killed many cells
and caused others to fall sick, so that they cannot perform
their work. We cannot get too much fresh air. Drafts
do not hurt us if we are thoroughly wrapped up; but it is
very dangerous to allow the wind to strike the body when
it is not well protected, and especially when it is damp
with perspiration.</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 6.</span> Properly prepared
for wet weather.</div>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">Why damp
clothing is
dangerous</div>

<p>Damp clothing chills the body very rapidly and kills
many cells. Indeed, if a single one of the germs that
cause pneumonia were to enter your
lungs while you were wearing damp
clothing, it would grow so rapidly
that you might have pneumonia in
a very little while. That is why it
is important to change your shoes
and stockings as soon as you get
them wet, and to take off immediately
any clothing that becomes
damp. It is hard for boys and girls
to keep their feet dry in the winter
and spring months, and rubbers are
a nuisance; but if you expect to
grow into the strong man or woman
you picture yourself becoming, you
must take care to wear your rubbers.
Otherwise you may become weak
and sickly, and never be able to do
the things you hope to do.</p>

<p>The feet are not the only part of
the body that needs to be kept dry.
A wet coat is just as harmful as
wet shoes and stockings; hence,
you should always carry an umbrella
or wear a raincoat when you go out into the rain.
Umbrellas are unhandy for boys and girls to carry, but
if you will remember that thousands of little cells in
your body are being injured when you get wet and
chilled, you will be willing to take your umbrella.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">When to
wear an
overcoat</div>

<p>In cold weather the same amount of clothing should
not be worn in the house and outdoors; for this reason,
we have overcoats. If you wear your overcoat in the
house, you will become overwarm and your underclothing
will then become damp with perspiration; when
you go outdoors into the cold air, this dampness will have
just the same effect as would dampness that comes from
outside.</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Figs.</span> 7 and 8. If you keep your overcoat on in the house, your
underclothes become damp from perspiration, and when you go outdoors
your body becomes chilled.</div>
</div>

<p>As soon as the weather gets cold, put on your overcoat
every time you go outdoors, and take it off as soon as you
come into the house. This is troublesome for boys and
girls to do, because they want to run in and out of the
house so often; but on the other hand, think of all the
cells you will kill if you do not do this, and you will certainly
consider it worth while to take off your coat and put
it on again.</p>

damp clothing? 5. When and why should overcoats be worn?</p>

<p><b>Remember.</b> 1. Clothing should be just heavy enough to keep
the body warm all the time. 2. Never take off your coat or
sit in a draft when you are too warm. 3. Since wearing damp
clothing causes a great deal of sickness, change your clothes
as soon as they become wet or damp. 4. Do not forget to

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">CHAPTER IV</a><br /><br />

<span class="small bold">THE USES OF FOOD</span></h3>


<p>We kill a great many of the cells in our bodies by starving
them; either we do not give them enough food or we
do not supply the right kind of food.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Why the
body needs
new cells</div>

<p>Not only must we feed the cells in our bodies, but we
must be constantly making new ones, for in all our work
or play, awake or asleep, we are constantly using up certain
cells. These cells are used to make the body go,
just as the engine uses coal to form the steam that gives
it power to run. Boys and girls grow fast and, of course,
if they expect to become well men and women, they must
make a great many new cells all the time, in addition to
those used in doing the work of the body. If we are to
make new cells we must have the right kind of food with
which to make them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">How the
body keeps
itself warm</div>

<p>We want to do something besides make new cells; we
want to keep warm and well the cells we already have.
No amount of clothing would keep you warm if you were
not making heat inside your body all the time, any more
than you could make a telephone post warm by putting
your coat on it. Therefore it is necessary to have food
that makes heat in the body, in addition to food that
builds cells.</p>

<p>We eat a great many kinds of foods, and all that we eat
is used either for building new cells or for producing heat
in the body. Thus we can divide all our foods into two
classes&mdash;building material and heat-producing material.
The type of building material is lean meat, and the type
of heat-producing material is fat meat and starches, such
as potatoes and bread. Milk contains much building<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
material as well as heat-producing material. That is
why a baby grows and keeps warm while he takes nothing
but milk.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The building
foods</div>

<p>Lean meat is the best of all building foods. Eggs are
largely a form of lean meat, and hence constitute a good
article of food for building purposes. Certain vegetables
contain a large per cent of building material; this is especially
true of dried beans and peas. Wheat flour and
corn meal (particularly when made of whole wheat and
unbolted meal) contain much building material.</p>

<p>It is possible for one to live and grow when eating only
vegetable matter. But the boy or girl who tries to become
a strong man or woman by eating only vegetables will be
disappointed; these are mostly heat-producing foods and
will not make strong bodies. Experience has proved that
the best results are obtained by eating what is called "a
mixed diet," that is, a diet composed partly of lean meats
and partly of fats and vegetables.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The heat-producing
foods</div>

<p>Of the heat-producing foods, fat is the most powerful.
Most of the fat that we eat is used immediately for producing
in the body heat, and therefore power, but a part
of it is stored up for future use. We see it in all healthy
young persons. It is this stored-up fat that gives the
body its rounded form. When any one has been sick he
is thin, because, to produce heat and power while he was
sick, he has had to use the fat stored up in his body. To
have such a supply of fat is like having a bank account to
draw on when out of work. We might call the deposits of
fat in our bodies our health banks.</p>

<p>Fat meat is not the only form in which we eat fats; we
eat them in a great many other ways. Certain vegetables,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
such as beans, contain an oil that forms fat. Ripe olives
contain a great deal of fatty oil. Butter is a very important
form of fat, and cream contains a large amount of it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Cost of suitable
foods</div>

<p>In selecting our foods we should think of two things:
<em>first</em>, the value of the food as a heat-producer or as a building
material; and <em>second</em>, the cost of the food. We may
like butter much better than bacon, but we should remember
that, pound for pound, bacon has a greater
nourishing power than butter, and a pound of bacon will
cost far less than a pound of butter.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>Vegetable foods produce heat by means of the starch
which they contain. All vegetables contain starch. This
starch is changed into a kind of sugar in the body, and
when thus changed it is used to produce heat and power.
All vegetable foods do not have the same heat-producing
power. There is more heat-producing power in a pound
of oatmeal than there is in ten pounds of cabbage. Ten
cents' worth of dried beans will produce more heat in the
body than will a dollar's worth of lettuce. Thirty cents'
worth of corn meal will do more building in the body than
will a piece of mutton worth a dollar and a half; but you
would have to eat a large amount of corn meal in order
to secure the building effect that would result from eating
a small quantity of mutton. In most fruits the only
nourishing quality is in the sugar they contain. This
sugar produces heat in the body just as starch does.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The real
value of
advertised
foods</div>

<p>You will see some foods advertised as possessing a
wonderful nourishing power. Do not let such statements<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
deceive you, for no food can have a greater nourishing
power than the things from which it is made. If the particular
food advertised is made from wheat flour, its
nourishing power is just the same as that of an equal
quantity of wheat flour. If it is made from corn meal, it
can have no greater nourishing power than has the meal
itself.</p>

<p>We have learned something about the materials necessary
in food and why they are needed. We must now
learn why foods that contain these materials sometimes
do not give us as good results as we might hope for.</p>

<p><b>Remember.</b> 1. Foods are used to make heat and power in the
body and to make the body grow. 2. The foods that make
the body grow are called building materials, and lean meat is

heat and power in the body are called heat-producing materials,
and fats and starches are the best heat-producers.
4. All vegetables contain starch, some of them contain a fatty
oil, and most of them contain some building material. 5. You
can get as much building and heat-producing material from
cheap foods as you can from expensive foods.</p></div>

<div class="sidenote">Value of
meat as a

<p>Meat is one of the most important articles of our diet.
It furnishes essential materials for building cells, and it
furnishes fat for making heat and power in the body.</p>

</div>

<div class="sidenote">Characteristics
of good meat</div>

<p>Since meat is so important an article of food, we should be
very careful to see that it is handled in a way to keep it always
perfectly clean. We should make sure that it comes
from animals absolutely free from any kind of disease, and
that no germs have been allowed to develop poisons in it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">How meat
may be
kept clean</div>

<p>While people know that they ought to pay attention to
these things, as a matter of fact they do not do it. They
take very little interest in the way the meat that they
are to eat is handled, and very few ever go to the
slaughterhouse or into the back room of the butcher
shop to see whether things are kept clean or not. Some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
people say, "Oh, we do not like to go there because it is
such a horrid place." If these places were kept clean,
as they should be, they would not be "horrid." And if
the people who buy the meat would occasionally visit
them, these places would be kept clean.</p>

</div>

<p>If the slaughterhouse and the butcher shop where your
meats are handled are not kept clean, the meat is sure to
have germs growing in it, and these germs will cause
poisons called <em>ptomaines</em> to form in the meat. There may
not be enough of them to make you sick, but there will be
enough to injure some of the cells of your body, and to
deprive you of much of the nourishment that you would
otherwise get from the meat.</p>

<p>All boys and girls should belong to a "Clean Meat
League" and should try to persuade their parents not to
buy meat from any butcher who does not keep his
slaughterhouse and butcher shop clean.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Dangers
from diseased
meat</div>

<p>Sometimes butchers are anxious to make money fast
and take little thought for the number of people they may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
make ill. They can buy sick cows very much cheaper
than well ones. The meat from a sick cow looks just like
the meat from a healthy cow, and the dishonest butcher
sells both at the same price. The meat from the diseased
cow is not suitable for food. It may cause you to have the
same disease that the cow had, or it may only be changed
to such an extent that it will not give you the nourishment
that you should get from good meat. The butcher
who sells you meat from a sick cow is of course dishonest.</p>

<div class="sidenote">How to prevent
the sale
of diseased
meats</div>

<p>Ask your father to visit the slaughterhouse where your
meat is killed. The only thing you need to do is to persuade
him to go and see whether the cattle are sick or not.
If the cattle look sick, you will not have to ask him not to
buy the meat. No person should ever eat meat that comes
from a diseased animal, no matter what the nature of the
sickness may be. People who will take the trouble to
visit the slaughterhouses occasionally, to investigate these
things for themselves, will not have such meat offered
them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Importance
of giving
animals
clean food</div>

<p>Animals that are fed on filthy food are not fit for human
consumption. Butchers often feed the offal (the insides)
of animals to the hogs. This makes the hogs fatten
quickly, but it also makes them diseased. When you go
to the slaughterhouse with your father, ask him to go
around to the back door, and if you see hogs eating this
filth, do not buy any more meat from that butcher.</p>

<span class="small bold">CARE OF FOOD&mdash;MILK</span></h3>


<div class="sidenote">Value of
milk as a
food</div>

<p>Milk is another important article of food. The Department
of Agriculture at Washington says that milk
furnishes sixteen per cent of the nourishment of the
people of the country. Milk is an excellent food when it
is pure, but when it is not pure it is very dangerous.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/figure012.jpg" width="600" height="269" alt="" />
<div class="cap-center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 12.</span> A clean dairy.</div>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">Milk as a
carrier of
germs</div>

<p>Milk has carried the germs of every disease of which
the germ is known; it has also carried many diseases of
which we do not know the germ. Disease germs grow
rapidly in milk, and they do not make the milk look
different or taste different from milk that is perfectly pure.
If you could take two bottles of milk entirely free from
disease germs and put typhoid fever germs in one, and
should set both bottles in an ice box for twenty-four hours,
you would not then be able to tell into which one you had
put the germs. The milk in both bottles would look and
taste just the same. The only difference between the milk
in the two bottles would be that if you drank from one it
would make you stronger and would furnish you with both<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
building material and power-producing material, while
if you drank from the other you would become very ill
and would probably die.</p>

<div class="sidenote">How disease
germs
get into
milk:</div>

<p>Since we cannot tell from the taste or the appearance of
milk whether or not there are disease germs in it, we must
take every precaution possible
to keep them out. The first
step is to learn where the
disease germs come from and
how they get into the milk.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 50%;">
<img src="images/figure013.jpg" width="250" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 13.</span> Polluted milk is
sure to come from a dairy
where cleanliness is not observed.</div>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">(<em>1</em>) By dirt
on the cow</div>

<p>Every cow has more or less
dirt on her sides and udder;
some have a great deal. When
the cow is milked, much of
the dirt falls into the milk
bucket. This dirt always contains
a great many germs of
different kinds, and many of
them are germs that cause disease. Straining the milk
will take out much of the dirt, but disease germs will go
through the finest strainer that was ever made.</p>

<p>In Figure 13 we see a man milking a dirty cow. The
owner has allowed his lot to become so dirty that the
cow cannot find a clean place in which to lie down.
If the man kept his lot clean, and if before milking
the light dirt on the cow's sides and udder were
wiped off with a damp cloth, no germs would fall into
the milk.</p>

<div class="sidenote">(<em>2</em>) By dirt
in the cow
barn</div>

<p>Another source of dirt and disease germs in milk is the
barn. The walls of a barn where cows are milked should
always be kept clean and should be whitewashed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
frequently. If this is done, there will be comparatively
little dirt on the walls to fall into the milk.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/figure014.jpg" width="600" alt="" />
<div class="cap-center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 14.</span> Only clean milk will come from a dairy where proper
precautions are taken.</div>
</div>

<p>Of course the walls and floors of a barn cannot be kept
absolutely clean. There will always be some dirt, and
the movements of the cows shifting their position and
switching their tails, will stir up the dust; so it is important
to remove the milk from the barn as soon as possible.
Milk cans should never be kept in the barn. The milk
should be taken directly from the barn to a cooling house
and there strained.</p>

<p>All barns where cows are kept should have plenty of
windows, that there may be an abundance of light and fresh
air. Cows need fresh air just as much as people do,
while a barn that is not supplied with plenty of light is
very likely to be a dirty barn.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>Keep dirt and disease germs out of the milk by keeping
the barn clean and by taking the milk away from the barn
as soon as possible.</p>

</div>

<div class="sidenote">(3) By dirt
on the
milkman</div>

<p>Another source of dirt and disease germs in milk is
the milkman or milkmaid. No matter how careful we
may be, our clothes hold more or less dust, and all dust
contains germs, very often disease germs. When a person
is milking a cow, the dust from his clothes is shaken off
into the milk. The only way to avoid this is to wear, while
milking, a special suit of clothes made of white cloth,
which may be washed as soon as it shows the least
particle of dirt.</p>

<p>The milker's hands, too, are often dirty. Perhaps he
carefully washes his hands after milking, but not before.
It is a common custom for milkers to moisten their hands
with milk while milking, and to do this frequently. The
result is that dirty milk from their hands is constantly
dropping into the milk pail. This is a very bad habit,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
and doubly bad if the milkman has not washed his hands
before milking.</p>

<p>Sometimes there are sick people at the dairy farm.
Often some one nurses a sick person until milking time
and then goes out and milks the cows. When this is done,
the milker is almost
sure to plant the
germs of the disease
in the milk. No milk
should ever be used
from any dairy where
there is an infectious
disease; and no one
who has charge of
a sick person, no
matter what the nature
of the sickness,
should ever handle
milk that is to be
used by others.</p>

<div class="cap-center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 17.</span> A model bottling establishment.</div>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">(4) By dirt
in cans
and bottles</div>

<p>The cans and bottles in which the milk is placed are
frequently sources of dirt and germs. Milk cans and
bottles are supposed to be thoroughly washed before milk
is put into them, and they should be thoroughly scalded
after they are washed. This is not always done, and
sometimes the bottles are not washed at all.</p>

<p>Some dairymen will tell you that the bottles and cans
are always washed and scalded just before the milk is put
into them, and that this is never neglected by any dairyman.
That is what a dairyman once told me. Then I
asked him how he accounted for the fact that I had found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
a milk ticket in the bottle with the fresh milk. Of course
he could not explain this, though I thought I could explain
it for him. The old milk bottle was returned to the
milkman with the ticket for the new milk inside it. The
deliveryman left the fresh milk, but forgot to take the
ticket out of the bottle; and the man who "washed" the
bottles must have forgotten to take out the ticket too. Of
course, the bottle was not washed at all, and if one bottle
goes unwashed, it is reasonable to assume that others are
neglected in the same way.</p>

<p>Milk bottles and cans should always be thoroughly
washed before fresh milk is put into them. This washing
cannot be done by little children; it is work for a man or
woman, and careful work at that.</p>

<div class="sidenote">(5) By polluted
water</div>

<p>I have just told you that milk vessels should be thoroughly
washed. It is true, however, that disease germs
may get into the milk through this very process of washing
the vessels. Water sometimes contains disease germs,
especially the germs that cause typhoid fever, cholera,
and other diseases of the intestines. Such water is said
to be polluted. When milk vessels are washed with
polluted water, the germs are left in them and thus get
into the milk. If the water used to wash the cans is
thoroughly boiled, the germs will be killed; hence it is
important to scald all milk vessels.</p>

<p>All water used about a dairy should be perfectly pure.
If there is the least suspicion about the quality of the
water, it should be examined by a chemist; and if it is
not pure, the milk from such a dairy should not be used.
In order to prevent the possibility of any infection, all
water used to wash milk vessels should be thoroughly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
boiled even when the water is known to be pure, and
the vessels should afterward be scalded, to kill any germs
that may be left after washing.</p>

<div class="sidenote">(6) By flies
falling into
the milk</div>

<p>Flies very frequently get into the milk. Later we shall
learn more about how flies carry germs, but at present it
is enough to know that on every fly there are a great
many germs, and whenever a fly gets into milk it plants
those germs and they grow very rapidly. As soon as a
cow is milked, the milk should be taken to a clean cooling
house, with screens at all the windows and doors,
and there strained into a vessel and cooled.</p>

<div class="sidenote">(7) By disease
in the
cow</div>

<p>The last way that we will mention by which germs get
into milk is by disease in the cow herself. Cows suffer
from many diseases, just as men do; and when a cow is
sick, her milk is very likely to contain the germs of the
disease that is making her sick. Especially is this true of
tuberculosis, or consumption, as it is called. A great
many children get consumption by drinking milk from
consumptive cows. No milk should ever be used from a
cow that is not healthy. All dairy cows should be examined
at frequent intervals by a competent veterinarian
to make sure that they are free from any disease.</p>

</div>

<div class="sidenote">Why partially
decomposed
foods
should not
be eaten</div>

<p>Vegetables and fruits that are partially decayed should
not be eaten. Even if an orange is decayed only on one
side, the products of decomposition&mdash;that is, the poisons
produced by decay&mdash;have extended all
through the orange. You cannot see them,
but they are there. It is the same with a
decaying apple, potato, or melon. It never
pays to buy partially decayed or stale fruits
or vegetables, for not only are they dangerous
to health, but they are so reduced
in nourishing qualities by decomposition
that you get little value for the money you
spend. It is always better economy to
buy fresh fruits and vegetables, or even
canned vegetables, when the latter are
properly put up.</p>

<div class="sidenote">What causes
decomposition</div>

<p>All decomposition (rotting) in fruits and vegetables is
due to the action of germs. If you will look at a bunch
of old grapes, you will notice that some of the grapes are
rotten, while others have dried up. Now, if you examine
them very carefully, you will find that all the decomposed
grapes have breaks in the skin. The break may be very
small, but it is there, and through this break the germs
that cause decomposition have entered. You will find
also that there is not the slightest break in the skin of any
grape that has dried up. The germs could not enter,
hence there has been no decomposition. It is the same
with other fruits and vegetables: if the germs that cause
decomposition cannot get inside, the fruit or vegetable
will dry up, but will not rot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 19.</span> Fruits displayed for

</div>

<p>Germs can go through a very small opening&mdash;so small
that you may not be able to find it; but if there is decomposition,
the hole is there.</p>

<p>The skin of the body acts
in the same way as the skin
of the grape and keeps out
a great many germs that
would make us sick were
they able to get through the
skin. They often get
through the skin when we
cut ourselves.</p>

<p>Meats decompose as well
as fruits and vegetables,
and the decomposition is
due to the presence of germs
in the meat. We cannot
keep all germs out of meat,
but we can keep out a great
many of them by having
everything clean about the
meat, by keeping it covered
as much of the time as
possible, and by handling it
only with clean hands.</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 20.</span> Fruits for sale, not
properly protected from flies,
dirt, and other sources of filth.</div>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">Why foods
do not decompose
in
very cold
places</div>

<p>When meat is kept so
cold that it is almost frozen,
the germs cannot grow, and
decomposition is prevented.
In this way meat can be kept perfectly free from decomposition
for several weeks. After the meat is taken from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
the cold storage room, it should be cut as soon as possible
into steaks, roasts, and other pieces for cooking; and
when taken to your home, it should be kept in an ice box
until the time to cook it. You cannot keep meat very long
at home without decomposition starting, because small
ice boxes are not cold enough to check entirely the growth
of germs.</p>

<p>Unless the meat is to be eaten hot, it should be cooled
after cooking and placed again in the ice box as soon
as possible. Cooking kills the germs that are in the
meat before it is cooked; but unless it is kept in a
very cold place and protected from flies after it is
cooked, germs will get into it again as soon as it is cold.
Cooked meat will decompose just the same as uncooked
meat.</p>

<div class="sidenote">What is
formed in
food by decomposition</div>

<p>When germs are allowed to grow in meat, as always
happens when it is not kept in a very cold place, these
germs cause the poisons that we call ptomaines. The people
who eat such meat become sick, and in many cases
do not recover. Cooking meat that contains ptomaines
will kill the germs that caused the poison, but it will not
destroy the poison that has already been formed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Why some
canned
meats are
poisonous</div>

<p>People not infrequently are poisoned by eating canned
meat. Sometimes you will hear it said that the poison
formed because the meat was in cans. This is not true;
the cans had nothing to do with the forming of the poison.
This was caused by germs that were allowed to grow in
the meat before it was cooked. When the meat was cooked
the germs were killed, but the poison was not destroyed.
In other words, the poison developed before the meat was
canned, and not after it was put into the cans.</p>

<span class="small bold">HARM DONE BY IMPROPER COOKING</span></h3>


<div class="sidenote">Effects of
improper
cooking</div>

<p>Nearly all food should be cooked before it is eaten;
but if the cooking is not properly done, much of the
nourishing power of the food is destroyed, and in some
instances the food is rendered actually injurious.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Why starchy
foods should
be thoroughly
cooked</div>

<p>Starchy foods should be thoroughly cooked in order
that the coverings which surround the little granules may
be broken or made soft. If starchy foods are not thoroughly
cooked, the little grains go into the stomach as
hard as grains of sand; then most of them are not digested
at all, but pass out of the system without furnishing any
nourishment to the body. If starchy foods are fried in
fats, as is the case with doughnuts, the granules of starch
become coated with fat. As the fat is not digested until
it comes to the intestines, the saliva never reaches the coverings
of the starch, and more work is thrown on the other
juices of the body. The result is that the little glands
which make these other juices are overworked, or else the
starch is not digested at all and therefore furnishes no
nourishment to the body. When bread is sticky (we
sometimes call it soggy) in the middle of the loaf, it is
because the flour has not been thoroughly cooked and the
little grains or granules of starch are still hard. You cannot
feel these granules between your fingers, but they are
hard just the same, and very little of such food is made
use of in the body.</p>

cooked, and remember, too, that all vegetables are chiefly
starchy in character.</p>

<div class="sidenote">How fats

<p>When fats are cooked over a very hot fire, an acid is

mean that when the fire is hot enough to broil a steak
well, it causes this acid to form; neither does it mean that
heat sufficient to boil the grease for cooking doughnuts
will cause it to form. Every cook knows that when she
fries fat meat over a fire that is too hot, it has a bitter
taste. This bitter taste is caused by an acid which will
destroy a part of the usefulness of the food in the body
and will cause many of the cells to stop doing their work
properly.</p>

<div class="sidenote">How meats
should be
cooked</div>

<p>There is a great difference of opinion in regard to cooking
foods, especially meats. Some people will tell you
that meats should not be cooked at all; that man originally
ate his meat raw and that this is the proper way.
Others will tell you that all meat should be cooked until
it does not show a particle of red, even until it is dry
throughout. These are the two extremes; and it is never
well to go to extremes in anything, especially in matters
that concern the health.</p>

<p>Meat should always be cooked, because by being cooked
it is made more easily digestible; but it should not be
cooked, until all the juices, which contain much of the
nourishing matter, are dried up and the meat made
hard. Meat that is cooked until it is dry and hard is
more difficult to digest than meat that is not cooked
at all.</p>

<p><b>Remember.</b> 1. Starchy foods should be thoroughly cooked so
that the fine grains may be softened and the food thus made
more easy to digest. 2. Fats should not be fried over a very
hot fire because too much heat causes a poison to form in the
fat. 3. Meats should be cooked, but never until they become
dry, as the juices in the meat contain most of the nourishing
material.</p></div>

<div class="sidenote">Why mealtime
should be
pleasant</div>

<p>The dining table should be the pleasantest and most
inviting place in the house. If you are complaining and
quarreling during the meal, you cannot enjoy the food;
you cannot eat it properly; and your ill temper will so
affect your body that you cannot properly digest what
you eat. A dirty table, with flies swarming over the food,
is not very tempting, and when seated at such a table,
one does not eat the things that are best for him and
sometimes does not eat anything at all.</p>

<div class="sidenote">How uninviting
luncheons
affect
the appetite</div>

<p>The luncheons that boys and girls take to school with
them are often prepared in so careless a way that they are
extremely uninviting. The substantial school lunch can be
made just as appetizing as the dainty refreshments at an
afternoon tea or at a party. If the same care is devoted to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
the preparation of the one as of the other, boys and girls
will eat their lunches with enjoyment and good appetites.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Why an attractive
table
calls for
pleasing
guests</div>

<p>If the table is made to look clean and inviting, do you
not think that you, in your turn, should make yourself
as neat and clean as possible before you come to it? Dirt
on your hands and face not only does not look well, but
contains a great many germs that may get into your food
and thus find their way into your body and try to make
you ill.</p>

</div>

<div class="sidenote">How foods
should be
eaten</div>

<p>Besides being eaten in pleasant surroundings, all food
should be eaten slowly. Let us suppose that we are all
seated at a clean, inviting table and everyone is clean and
happy. Before the children is the very kind of food that
is best for them. It looks good and they know it is good,
and they want to eat all they can of it. But they think of
a game of jacks or of ball that they want to play as soon
as dinner is over, so they simply "bolt" their food.</p>

<p>What are teeth made for? Why, to chew with, of
course. But why are we given some teeth that are sharp
like knives, and some that are flat like millstones? It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
seems probable that these different kinds of teeth are intended
for special purposes, and so they are. If our teeth
were intended only for cutting our food into bits small
enough to swallow without causing pain, there would be
no need for any except the sharp, knife-like teeth. But
we have the big grinders, which were made to use, and it
is very important that they be used in the right way.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Why food
should be
thoroughly
chewed</div>

<p>We do not chew our food simply to make it fine
enough to swallow, but for quite another reason as well.
In our mouths there is a fluid called <em>saliva</em>. Think of
something that you are very fond of eating, and the mere
thought of it makes the saliva come into your mouth.
This saliva has a very important duty to perform in connection
with preparing the food for the little cells of the
body. Each little grain of starch&mdash;and you will remember
that all vegetable foods are composed largely of starch&mdash;has
a capsule about it. This simply means that it is done
up in a little package. The saliva helps to open this
capsule by making it soft (just as water will soften the
paper on a package of candy), so that the other digestive
juices can reach the starch and turn it into the kind of
sugar that is used in the body. If you do not chew your
food very fine, the saliva will not reach the starch granules,
the little packages of starch will be hard to open when
they go into the stomach, and much of the starch will
never be made use of in the body. The saliva has much
the same action on the coverings of the little packages of
meat, for all the meat that we eat is done up in similar
packages.</p>

<p>A great Englishman, Mr. Gladstone, who lived to be
eighty-three, made a practice of chewing every bite of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
food twenty times, and he thought this had a great deal
to do with his being such a strong and well man and living
to such an old age.</p>

<div class="sidenote">When desserts
are
not harmful</div>

<p>After you have eaten meats, bread, and vegetables, it
will do no harm to eat a piece of pie or cake, or a dish of
ice-cream or some other dessert. It is not easy, as a rule,
to digest these things (that is, to get them into such shape
that they can be used as food by the little cells in the body),
but a moderate amount of them is very good for boys and
girls, as well as for grown people. If you refuse to eat the
meat and bread, but wait until the dessert is served and
then fill your stomach with sweet things, you will be
starving some of the little cells, and you will be reminded
of this very soon. Sometimes you may be reminded of
it by having a pain in your stomach, but more often by
getting low grades in your lessons at school. Your teacher
will know it, too, because you will be so restless and inattentive
in your classes that she will have to give you a
low grade in deportment as well.</p>

<span class="small bold">DANGERS FROM POOR TEETH</span></h3>


<p>We have learned that chewing is not merely a process
of cutting our food into such lumps as we can swallow
without hurting ourselves; but that the food must be
ground up fine and thoroughly mixed with the saliva, that
the saliva may reach every particle of starch. If we do not
have good teeth, we cannot grind our food as fine as it
ought to be ground, and, as a result, a great deal of the
starch will not be reached by the saliva.</p>

<p>Nature starts every child with a full set of good, strong,
clean teeth. These teeth, which we call first, or milk, teeth,
are not very large, but they are perfect in every respect and
last until the second, or permanent, teeth come in. That
is, they will last so long <em>if they are taken care of</em>. If they
are not taken care of, they will decay just as the later teeth
will decay, and they must be cared for in the same way.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Why we
have baby
or milk
teeth</div>

<p>Boys and girls sometimes wonder why they have a set
of teeth that come out before they can have the teeth that
must last them the rest of their lives. This is simply
because there is not room enough in a child's mouth for
the big, permanent teeth. We must have teeth while our
jaws are growing, so we have first a set of little teeth.
Then just as soon as our jaws get large enough for the big
teeth, the little teeth come out and the big ones come in.</p>

<p>Teeth are about the hardest substance in the body. If
we take care of our second teeth, they should last as long
as we live. The only reason they do not last is because we
do not take care of them. If a person would keep his
teeth clean all the time, he would rarely be obliged to have
a single permanent tooth pulled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Why teeth
break easily</div>

<p>Teeth are so hard that they are brittle, that is, they
break easily. Glass is brittle, and you can chip off a piece
of glass with a pin by sticking the pin into a crack in the
glass. In just the same way you can chip off a piece of a
tooth by sticking a pin between two teeth. That is what
often happens when people
pick their teeth with pins, or
with any other hard substance.
A metal toothpick is just as
bad as a pin.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 50%;">
<img src="images/figure023.jpg" width="250" alt="" />
<div class="cap-center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 23.</span> Teeth were not intended
for nutcrackers.</div>
</div>

<p>Another way by which little
pieces are chipped off the
teeth is by biting hard things.
Sometimes we see boys and
girls cracking nuts with their teeth; again we see them trying
to bite wires in two. They put their teeth to many uses
for which teeth were never made. They do not realize,
while they are abusing their teeth in this way, that they
are probably chipping the enamel, which is the hard, shiny
covering of the tooth, and are destroying the one protection
that their teeth have against decay.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Why teeth
decay</div>

<p>When a little piece is chipped off a tooth, an opening is
made through the enamel. Through this opening germs
may lodge in the inner part of the tooth, which is soft.
When this happens, a little black speck appears on the
tooth, and after a while the tooth begins to ache. If you
have a toothache, you go to a dentist, and he probably
finds that germs have caused the tooth to decay until
there is a hole extending into the very center of it.</p>

<p>Teeth grow very close together, but there is always a
little space between them. Whenever you eat anything,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
particles of the food get into these spaces and if allowed
to remain there, soon decompose. These decomposing
particles of food between the teeth will gradually soften
even the enamel, and in this way little openings are made
for germs to get into the teeth.</p>

<div class="sidenote">How to care
for the
teeth</div>

<p>Never pick the teeth. You cannot make them clean
by picking them. Every
morning and night brush
your teeth with a stiff
toothbrush and a little
tooth powder. Brush them
both crosswise and up and
down, to get out everything
from between them. Do
not think you have done
your duty if you brush only
your front teeth, the ones
that show. Brush the back
teeth just as thoroughly as you do the front teeth. Very
few people will see your back teeth, but these decay just
as fast as your front teeth, if they are not kept clean.</p>

<div class="sidenote">How often

<p>Twice each year you should have a dentist examine
your teeth, to see if there are any little spots where decay
has started. If you have kept your teeth perfectly clean
all the time, and have not chipped off little pieces, there
will be none of these decayed spots. But it is a safe plan to
have the teeth looked over at least twice a year, for you may
have broken a tooth without knowing it, and by the time
a decayed spot is large enough to cause pain, or has made
a hole that you can feel with your tongue, it has advanced
much farther than it should have been permitted to do.</p>

<span class="small bold">NECESSITY FOR PURE AIR AND HOW TO SECURE IT</span></h3>


<p>We have learned how the cells of the body are killed by
starvation. Now let us learn how they are choked to death,
or killed by lack of air.</p>

<div class="sidenote">How air is
changed in
the body</div>

<p>The cells of the body need <em>oxygen</em>, and the only way we
can give it to them is by means of air. Every time we take
air into our lungs we are giving oxygen to the red corpuscles
or cells in the blood, which distribute it to the other
cells in the body. The air that goes into our lungs, if it is
fresh and pure, contains a great deal of oxygen and a very
little of another gas called <em>carbon dioxid</em>. The air that
comes out of the lungs contains a very little oxygen and a
great deal of carbon dioxid. The blood not only takes the
oxygen out of the air, but gives carbon dioxid to the air.
This carbon dioxid is very poisonous, and would kill the
cells if it remained in the blood; hence we should never
breathe the same air twice. There is no lack of fresh air
in the world, and no excuse for anyone's ever breathing air
that is not pure.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Effects of
impure air</div>

<p>If you close all the windows and doors in the schoolroom
and shut up the ventilators, you will soon find that you are
not able to pay close attention to your studies, and in a
little while you will begin to feel drowsy. This is because
you have used up so much of the oxygen in the air that
there is no longer enough to supply the demands of the little
cells, and because, in addition, you are taking into your
bodies the poisonous carbon dioxid that has been breathed
out into the room. It takes a great deal of fresh air to
supply the body with oxygen&mdash;about 1,250 cubic feet of air
each hour. With thirty or forty children in a room, it does<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
not take long to use up all the oxygen. So there should
be a constant supply of fresh air coming into the room.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 60%;">
<img src="images/figure025.jpg" width="300" alt="" />
<div class="cap-center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 25.</span> Results of breathing
good and bad air.</div>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">Methods
of ventilation</div>

<p>It is not only in the schoolroom that you need oxygen.
When you are out-of-doors you get an abundance of fresh
air, but from a great many
houses every bit of fresh air
is shut out. It is always
possible to let an abundance
of fresh air into any
house without causing a
draft. A piece of board can
be made to fit into a window
frame so that when the
window is raised, the air will
be directed upward and will
not cause a draft. Hot-air
furnaces are made with cold-air
pipes. The fresh air from
outdoors comes through
these cold-air pipes and, after being heated, is driven into
the rooms of the house. Some people think they will save
coal by closing these drafts. Not only do they not save
coal (for the furnace does not give as much heat when this
draft is closed), but they kill their body cells by refusing to
give them oxygen. The cold-air pipe in a hot-air furnace
should always be kept wide open.</p>

<p>In houses heated with steam or hot water, either the windows
must be kept open, or some other way must be provided
for admitting fresh air and taking out foul air. These
arrangements constitute a system of ventilation. Houses
heated with stoves must also be provided with some means<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
of ventilation. The stove, by its draft, takes out a little
of the foul air, but it will not take out more air than one
person poisons.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Why windows
should
be kept open
at night</div>

<p>Many people seem to think that they do not need fresh
air at night, and they close their bedroom windows as tight
as they can. Those people do not sleep well and often
have bad colds. You should always sleep with your windows
open. If it is impossible for you to have your windows
open without having a draft, choose the draft; it
will do you no harm if you are well covered, and under no
circumstances will it do you as much harm as the foul air
that you breathe if your window is closed. Some persons
(fortunately they are few nowadays) will tell you that night
air is dangerous. I wonder what kind of air these people
expect to breathe at night. Do they expect to fill the room<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
in the daytime with enough air for use at night? Such air
would certainly not be very fresh. Night air is the only
kind of air that it is possible to breathe at night.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The ventilation
of
public assembly
rooms</div>

<p>Churches, theaters, and ten-cent shows are often very
poorly ventilated. You can always tell a poorly ventilated
room by the foul odor when you go into it from the fresh
air, and it is not wise to stay in such a room. You are
killing the cells in your body when you do so, and you will
very probably come out of it with a bad cold. When the
fresh air strikes you, you feel chilly and you may think you
are taking cold then, but in reality you took cold in that
room full of foul air.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Ventilation
of
workshops</div>

<p>Workshops are often poorly ventilated. No person
should ever work in a badly ventilated place. The labor
unions frequently strike for higher wages, but until recently
a strike for better ventilation was rarely heard of. Better
ventilation would be practically equal to an increase in
wages, because there would be fewer doctors' bills to pay,
and less likelihood of losing work through illness. Always
have plenty of pure, fresh air wherever you are&mdash;in school,
in bed, at work, or at play.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Why we
should
breathe
through
the nose</div>

<p>The cells in the skin of the nose secrete a watery fluid,
and this fluid serves to moisten the air as it passes through
the nose. Dry air irritates the mucous membrane which
lines the nose, throat, and lungs, and it is very important
that the air be moistened before it reaches the throat. Air
is also warmed as it passes through the nose. Cold air is
irritating to the throat and lungs. The small hairs in the
nose catch the dust and dirt in the air and prevent it from
going into the lungs.</p>

<p>The nose was made to breathe through, and all the air<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
that goes into your lungs should pass through your nose, in
order that it may be moistened, warmed, and cleansed.</p>

</div>

<div class="sidenote">Why some
children
breathe
through
the mouth</div>

<p>Frequently we see boys and girls breathing through the
mouth. They do this because there is something in the
nose that prevents the air from passing freely through it.
If there were nothing in the way, the child would breathe
through the nose instead of the mouth, because the natural
way of breathing is through the nose.</p>

<p>The most common reason for mouth-breathing is the
growth of small lumps in the throat just behind the nose.
These little lumps are called adenoids. They are not
natural, and should be taken out. We do not know why
they grow in some children and not in others, but we do
know that they should be taken out so that the child can
breathe easily through the nose. Large tonsils also cause<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
boys and girls to breathe through the mouth. Tonsils that
are large enough to cause the child to breathe through the
mouth ought always to be taken out. Large tonsils and
adenoids are often found in the same child.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Effects of
mouth-breathing</div>

<p>When a child breathes through his mouth all the time,
his face takes on a peculiar shape. His upper lip grows
long, his lower jaw drops back, and his whole face looks
flat. His voice has a peculiar sound, and he finds it very
hard to keep up in his classes at school. Children with
adenoids and large tonsils are always backward in their
school work, and may become deaf if the adenoids and
tonsils are not removed.</p>

<p>If you breathe through your mouth instead of through
the nose, go to the doctor and let him see if you have adenoids
or large tonsils; if you have, let him take them out.
You cannot possibly grow into a strong, healthy man or
woman if you have adenoids and do not have them removed.</p>

<span class="small bold">REST ESSENTIAL TO HEALTH</span></h3>


<div class="sidenote">Why exercise
is necessary</div>

<p>Exercise is necessary to make our bodies grow and become
strong. If we stayed in bed all the time, our muscles
would not grow and we could not even walk. If we did
not exercise them, the cells in our brains would not grow
and we should not know anything. Every part of our
body must have exercise, that is, each part must do some
work every day. If we used only one part of the body and
did not give the other parts any work to do, only the
part that we used would grow, while all the rest of the
body would be small and weak.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Proportion
of rest
required</div>

<p>While every part should do some work each day, the
whole body needs also to have a proper amount of rest.
Even the heart, which seems to be working all the time,
must rest. It rests between each beat. The muscles with
which we breathe rest between each breath. Every person
must have a certain amount of rest each day. A man should
have at least eight hours' sleep in every twenty-four hours;
boys and girls should have from nine to ten hours' sleep in
every twenty-four. It is only while we are sleeping that we
have complete rest.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Effect of
overwork</div>

<p>Everybody should have some work to do. Boys and
girls should learn that work is a part of life, though
they should not be expected to do too much. They
should not be required to get up at four o'clock in
the morning and work until eight, then go to school
until four in the afternoon, and then work again until
dark. They cannot do this and keep well. Such
children will surely neglect their lessons and will fail
to keep up in their classes. It is not the children's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
fault, but the fault of the people who give them so
much to do outside of school.</p>

<p>Sometimes bright children fall behind in their classes
and seem to be sleepy during school hours. Very often
these children do not have to do any work at home, but
play all the time they are out of school. We usually find
that these children not only play all the afternoon, but also
go to parties at night and often stay up until midnight.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 29.</span> Children work when they play. The little girl skipping
rope is killing the body cells by overwork; she has skipped more
than one hundred times and is exhausted.</div>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">Ways in
which children
overwork
their
bodies</div>

<p>You may think it is not work to go to a party, but it really
is. You are working the muscles and the cells of your
brain when you are playing games, and these get tired
from play work just as they do from working. It is more
fun to do play work than to do real work, but the cells are
tired and need rest after either kind of exercise. When you
go to a party and stay up until midnight, you do not get nine
hours of sleep. How do you expect the cells of your bodies
to get enough rest when you treat them in this way?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>Another thing you do at parties is to eat food that
tastes good, but which is not good building material or
nourishing for the cells of the body. These things eaten
late at night stay in your stomach long after you have
gone to bed, and the cells of your stomach do not have a
chance to rest at all.</p>

<p>Children should have their parties in the afternoon.
You can have just as much fun at a party in the afternoon
as you can at night, and then your stomach will have time to
dispose of the cake and candies you have eaten, and will be
ready to rest when you go to bed.</p>

<p>Small children should be in bed by eight o'clock at
night, and even big girls and boys should be asleep by ten
o'clock every night. If you do not give your bodies rest,
you can never grow into strong men and women.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The importance
of
regular
meals</div>

<p>We have learned that every part of the body needs regular
rest. Your stomach is a part of your body. In the
stomach and intestines all the food is changed so that the
little cells can make use of it. Do you think the cook would
serve good meals if she were kept cooking all the time,
both night and day? You know she would soon stop cooking
for you if you did not give her time to rest. Your
stomach does work that is even more important to you
than cooking.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Why meals
should be
at least
four hours
apart</div>

<p>It takes about four hours for your stomach to dispose
of what you give it at a single meal. If you eat your breakfast
at eight o'clock, your stomach is going to be kept busy
to get rid of it by noon. Of course you expect to give it
more work to do at noon; that is, you expect to eat a good
luncheon. It will be after four o'clock by the time your
stomach has finished the task you put on it at noon, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
there will be only about an hour and a half for the stomach
to rest before you will be ready to give it another four hours'
task, digesting your supper. This means that your stomach
cannot go to sleep until ten o'clock. If you eat three meals
a day, you will give your stomach just about two hours'
rest between eight in the morning and ten at night. If you
let it rest from ten at night until eight in the morning, it
is not likely to give you any trouble.</p>

<div class="sidenote">When and
why candy
eating is
harmful</div>

<p>Some people will not let their stomachs rest at all. Often
boys and girls give their stomachs extra work to do by eating
sweetmeats in the middle of the morning while their
stomachs are still busy with breakfast. Then, as soon
as school is out in the afternoon, they want to eat more cake
and candy, and thus take away from the stomach the little
rest it has a right to expect before it goes to work on supper.
Then suppose they go to a party and eat again about midnight.
How much time will the stomach have to rest before
breakfast?</p>

<div class="sidenote">When candy
eating is
not harmful</div>

<p>Now, I have not said that boys and girls must not eat
candy; and what is more, I am not going to say any such
thing. You may go home and tell your mother that candy
is good for girls and boys and that they like it so well they
ought to have it&mdash;no, not all the time. Here is the part
that some of you will not like. Girls and boys ought to
have all they want just after eating luncheon or dinner.
If you have eaten a hearty meal, it is entirely safe for you
to eat candy then; you will not be giving extra work to your
stomach, for the candy will be taken care of along with the
rest of the meal.</p>

<span class="small bold">CARE OF THE EYE AND EAR</span></h3>


<div class="sidenote">The loss of
sight</div>

<p>Sight is one of the greatest blessings we have. Think
how dreadful it is to be blind. If you take care of your
eyes, there is no reason why you should be blind; but if
you do not take care of your eyes, there is a possibility that
you may lose your sight. Most of the blind people in the
world became blind because their eyes were not given
proper care, and most of this lack of care happened when
these people were babies.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Figs.</span> 30 and 31. The roller towel is a common source of infection
of eyes in schools; every school should have properly constructed
wash-rooms, with individual towels.</div>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">How germs
get into
the eyes</div>

<p>Many of the diseases that affect the eyes are catching.
They are not carried through the air, but are transmitted
by the use of a towel or handkerchief used by someone
who had the disease. Never use the towel or handkerchief
that another has used.</p>

<p>Germs may be rubbed into the eyes. Keep your hands
away from your eyes. Your hands may have disease germs
on them, and when you rub your eyes you may put the
disease germs into them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">How eyes
are overworked</div>

<p>Many boys and girls ruin their eyes by making them do
too much work. They do this by reading in a poor light, by
reading where the light strikes into the eyes, or by reading
in a bad position, as when in bed or lying down. When
you are reading, drawing, or doing any work with the eyes,
always have the best light possible, which means that the
light should fall on your book or work over your left shoulder.
If you are only reading, it does not make much difference
which shoulder the light comes over, provided it
comes from behind. If you are writing or drawing, and
the light comes over your right shoulder, it makes the
shadow of your hand fall just where you want to see.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/figure032-033.jpg" width="600" alt="" />
<div class="cap-center"><span class="smcap">Figs.</span> 32 and 33. Correct positions for reading and writing.</div>
</div>

<p>Another way of working your eyes too much is by trying
to see when the eyes are not focused right. Sometimes
people are said to be near-sighted, because they cannot
see very well at a distance. This is due to the fact that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
eyeball is too long, so that the lens does not cause the rays
of light to focus on the retina. Some people are called far-sighted.
This means that they can see well at a distance,
but that it is hard for them to see things close to them.
Far-sighted children can usually see things near by, but
they do this by making the muscle that rules the lens of
the eye work too hard.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Method of
testing
the eyes</div>

<p>Probably your teacher has a test chart and can tell you
whether your eyes are properly focused. If your eyes are
not focused right, that is, if you cannot see the line of
letters marked <b>20</b> when you are twenty feet from this
chart, there is something wrong with your eyes. In that
case, you are not only injuring them by trying to study,
but you are hurting the whole body by overworking a part
of it. If you cannot see the letters on the test card clearly
at a distance of twenty feet, ask your father to send you
to a specialist who will fit you with the proper glasses or
will treat your eyes so that you can see well.</p>

<div class="sidenote">How to
test the
hearing</div>

<p>Sometimes children are backward in their school work
because they cannot hear well. Your teacher can test
your hearing by holding a watch near your ear. If you
cannot hear a watch tick when it is held six feet from your
ear, ask your father to take you to your doctor, that he may
treat your ears.</p>

<div class="sidenote">How to
care for
the ears</div>

<p>If your hearing is perfect, the best way to take care of
the ears is to let them alone. Never try to dig into the canal
that leads to the middle ear. The ears must of course be
washed to keep them clean, but in washing the ear you
should not touch the delicate canal leading to the drum.
A great specialist once said, "Never put anything smaller
than your elbow into your ear," to which another great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
specialist added, "And wrap a towel around your elbow."
Never try to dig the wax out of your ears; it belongs in your
ears; it is there for a purpose, so let it alone. If it becomes
hardened, you cannot get it out and will only injure your
ears in trying to do so. An ear spoon is a dangerous thing.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><b>Questions.</b> 1. State the chief cause of loss of sight. 2. How
can you keep germs out of your eyes? 3. Name three ways
by which you may overwork the eyes. 4. Tell how to take
care of the ears.</p>

<p><b>Remember.</b> 1. Overworking the eyes is as injurious as overworking
the stomach. 2. Keep your hands away from your
eyes; germs on your hands may get into your eyes and cause
them to become sore. 3. You overwork your eyes when you
try to read or write in a poor light or in a bad position, as when
lying down. 4. You overwork your eyes when you try to study
with eyes that are not properly focused. 5. Keep your fingers
out of your ears. 6. Take care of your ears by letting them
alone.</p></div>

<span class="small bold">CARE OF THE SKIN</span></h3>


<p>If you break or cut the skin on your body, you make an
opening through which germs can get in. You cannot
always help breaking your skin, but you can always wash
the break with soap and
water, and put a clean cloth
over it to keep out germs.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The work
of the sweat
glands</div>

<p>The work of the little sweat
glands is very important to
your health. These glands
are just as important as the
kidneys, and if they did not
do their work, you would die
very quickly. If your body is
covered with dirt, the work of
these glands is seriously interfered
with; and when the
sweat glands are not doing
their full amount of work, the
kidneys must do more than their share. It is never right
to make one part of your body do the work intended for
another part.</p>

<div class="cap-center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 34.</span> A model bathroom.</div>
</div>

<p>When the body is dirty, not only are the sweat glands
interfered with, but the little sebaceous (oil) glands become
plugged up, and blackheads appear on the face and
body.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Importance
of bathing</div>

<p>In order that the various glands of the skin may be kept
in good health, it is necessary for us to keep clean. To
do this we wash our faces and hands and bathe our bodies.
Someone may ask, "How often ought a person to take a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
bath?" The question cannot be answered, except to say,
"Just as often as may be necessary for you to keep absolutely
clean." Some people do not have to bathe as often
as others, but no one can keep clean unless he takes a bath
at least twice a week.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Hot or
cold baths</div>

<p>Another question that is frequently asked is, "Is it
better to take a bath in cold or hot water?" This is another
question that cannot be
answered in the same way for
every person. A cold bath is
more stimulating than a warm
bath. If, after you have taken
a cold bath and rubbed yourself
briskly with a rough towel,
the skin becomes red and warm,
a cold bath is best for you.
But if, after you have taken a
cold bath and rubbed yourself for not more than ten minutes,
the skin appears bluish and cold, a cold bath is not
good for you, and you should not take it. A cold bath
should always be taken in the morning, just after getting
out of bed, and a warm bath should always be taken in the
evening, just before going to bed.</p>

cared for, and a nail not
properly cared for. Which
should you prefer to have?</div>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">How to
care for
the nails</div>

<p>The finger nails and toe nails are a part of the skin and
they also need to be taken care of. You will see at the
root of your finger nails a thin layer of skin that is inclined
to grow out with the nail. If this skin is not kept pushed
back it becomes rough, breaks into little shreds, and forms
"hang nails." This little band of skin should always be
kept carefully pushed back. The finger nails should be
kept evenly and neatly trimmed, but they should not be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
cut so close to the skin that the ends of the fingers project beyond
the nails. The nails are for the protection of the ends
of the fingers and toes. Nails that are trimmed unevenly
and nails that are bitten off are ugly and indicate untidy
habits. The shape of the nails should follow the outline of
the ends of the finger. Neither is it a sensible fashion
to trim the nails to points or to let them grow very long.</p>

<p>The toe nails need attention just as much as do the finger
nails. They should be trimmed to follow the shape of the
toe. Failure to trim the toe nails properly will result in
ingrowing nails.</p>

<p>Dirt is very likely to collect under the nails. This should
always be carefully cleaned out. You cannot wash this
dirt out unless you use a stiff nail brush. If you clean your
nails just after you wash your hands, you will find that it
will be much easier to get the dirt out while the dirt and
the nail are both softened by the soap and water. In
cleaning your nails, use a dull nail cleaner or a smooth
wooden stick. Do not scrape the inside of the nail with a
sharp knife. This scraping of the inside of the nails will
cause them to catch the dirt more easily, as well as to grow
thicker and thicker until they become very ugly. Neat,
clean finger nails help to make pretty hands; dirty, untidy
nails spoil the prettiest hands.</p>

<p><b>Remember.</b> 1. If you do not keep your body clean, the glands

should take a bath at least twice a week; some persons need
a bath every day in order to keep clean. 3. If you take a bath
in cold water, and the skin does not become warm and pink

for you. 4. Cold baths should be taken in the morning on

<span class="small bold">COMMON POISONS TO BE AVOIDED</span></h3>


<p>Many people are killing the cells of their bodies by
taking certain poisons into them. There are many kinds
of poisons that can be taken into the body, but we are going
to learn now about only two.
These are tobacco and alcohol.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 50%;">
<img src="images/figure036.jpg" width="250" alt="" />
<div class="cap-center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 36.</span> Effect of cigarette
smoking.</div>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">Proof that
tobacco is
a poison</div>

<p>Tobacco is a poison. Those
of you who have tried to smoke
know this, because it made you
sick the first time you tried it.
There are many other indications
that tobacco is a poison.
We know that it affects the red
blood cells in such a way that
they do not carry the oxygen
as well as do those of people
who do not smoke. We know
that it has a very bad effect on
the heart and that it interferes
with the action of the nervous system.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The extra
work caused
by tobacco</div>

<p>When certain poisons get into the body, the blood makes
something that will counteract the effects of those poisons.
After one has used tobacco for some time, the cells of
the body will take care of the tobacco poison by making an
antidote for it. More than this, they begin to want it all
the time. The tobacco user forces the cells of his body
to make an antidote for this poison every time he
uses tobacco. Thus he makes the cells do work that
is unnecessary, and keeps them from doing work that
is necessary.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Other bad
effects of
tobacco:
(<em>1</em>) On the
nose and
throat</div>

<p>Tobacco smoke irritates the cells that line the throat and
nose and causes inflammation. This is why so many
smokers have catarrh. Smoking is not the only cause of
catarrh, for people who do not smoke often have this
trouble, but it is one of the most frequent causes. Smoking
also irritates the throat so badly that many of those who
smoke have "smoker's throat." This is a bad form of sore
throat that can be cured only by stopping the use of tobacco.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 37.</span> The athlete knows that alcohol and tobacco are foes to
speed, strength, and nervous control. (<em>From photograph of "The
Sprinter," modelled by Dr. R. Tait McKenzie.</em>)</div>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">(<em>2</em>) On the
blood</div>

<p>People who smoke a great deal have fewer red corpuscles
(the little red cells of the blood) than those who do
not smoke. Especially is this true of cigarette smokers.
It is the lack of red blood cells that causes the cigarette
smoker to look pale and sallow.</p>

<p>It is probably not the direct effect of tobacco that
causes the loss of red blood cells, but something that is
connected with the act of smoking. When you take smoke
into your mouth, you take in at the same time a gas known<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
as <em>carbon monoxid</em>. This gas is very poisonous to the
body, and combines with the red blood cells in such a way
that they cannot take up the oxygen in the lungs and carry
it to the rest of the cells in the body. The cigarette smoker
almost always inhales the smoke, and thus he absorbs a
great deal more of the carbon monoxid than the man who
does not inhale the smoke. Of course, the more of this
gas he takes into his body, the more red blood cells will be
affected and the less oxygen will be taken to the other cells.</p>

<div class="sidenote">(<em>3</em>) On the
nervous
system</div>

<p>We do not know just how tobacco affects the cells of
the nervous system. It may be that they are affected mostly
by being deprived of oxygen, or it may be that the tobacco
affects them directly. However the harm is done, we know
that the cells of the nervous system are affected by tobacco.
One of the nerves that is most commonly affected by the
use of tobacco is the nerve of the eye, the nerve that enables
us to see. We know that when people use tobacco a
great deal they sometimes lose their sight. This does not
happen to everyone who uses tobacco, but you can never
tell whom it will affect in this way. The only safe thing to
do is not to use tobacco, and then you will know that you
will not lose your sight from this cause.</p>

<div class="sidenote">(<em>4</em>) On the
stomach</div>

<p>The use of tobacco affects the stomach. People who use
tobacco a great deal are likely to have indigestion. The
tobacco causes this probably by depriving the stomach
cells of oxygen through its effect on the blood cells.</p>

<div class="sidenote">(<em>5</em>) On the
heart</div>

<p>Tobacco has a very bad effect on the heart. People
who use much tobacco have what they call "palpitation of
the heart," but doctors call it "tobacco heart," because it
is caused by the use of tobacco. No insurance company
will insure a person who has "tobacco heart."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>Most boys grow up to be men before they manage to use
enough tobacco to cause tobacco heart. However, long
before they are grown, they show that the tobacco has affected
their hearts, because they are short of breath and
stand about as much chance of winning a race as does a
mouth-breather.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Effects of
alcohol:</div>

<p>The effect of alcohol is a subject on which I want to
speak very plainly and frankly, because I do not want the boys
and girls who read this to get the same idea that I got
when I was in school, or to be affected by it as I was. When
I was a little boy I was taught that if a person drank alcohol
in any form the lining of his stomach would be eaten up. In
proof of this statement I was shown a picture of an ulcerated
stomach that was said to have resulted from drinking
whisky. Naturally I expected to find that people who
drank whisky would not be able to eat anything at all, or
would be troubled a great deal with pain in their stomachs.
To my surprise, I found that many people had ulcers of
the stomach who never took an alcoholic drink, while many
of those who drank a great deal seemed to have the best
of appetites and were never troubled with their stomachs.
As a result, I came to the conclusion that all this talk about
the evil effects of alcohol was foolishness. Later I studied
medicine, and learned that the effect of alcohol on the
stomach is, in reality, the least of its evils. But I want to
impress upon you that, as a result of forty years' study, I
consider alcohol the most dangerous thing in the world
to-day. By "alcohol" we mean any drink that contains
alcohol, such as whisky, wine, brandy, beer, etc.</p>

<div class="sidenote">(<em>1</em>) On the
stomach</div>

<p>When alcohol is taken into the stomach, it first causes
a congestion; that is, it causes an increase in the quantity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
of blood in the blood vessels of the stomach. It might
seem that this would aid digestion in the stomach, but it
does not, because alcohol affects the food in the stomach
in such a way that it prevents the gastric juice from acting
on the food. If the use of alcohol is persisted in, it causes
the little cells in the stomach that make the gastric juice
to become filled with fat, and then those cells cannot make
the gastric juice. Thus, continued use of alcohol causes a
smaller supply of gastric juice, and the food passes from
the stomach into the intestines without having been acted
upon by the gastric juice, as it should have been. The
result is that the food decomposes in the intestines and
a poison is formed. This poison is taken up by the vessels
that carry the food from the intestines and kills a great
many of the cells of the body.</p>

<p>Alcohol does not burn holes in the stomach, but it destroys
the usefulness of the stomach by its action on the
cells that secrete the gastric juice.</p>

<div class="sidenote">(<em>2</em>) On the
liver</div>

<p>When alcohol is taken into the stomach, very little of it
reaches the intestines. It is rapidly absorbed by the lining
of the stomach and passes into the blood. The blood
from the stomach goes directly to the liver. The alcohol
makes the cells of the liver hard and causes them to become
filled with fat, as it does the cells of the stomach. In this
way it destroys the action of these cells and prevents their
doing the work for which they are intended. From the
liver the alcohol goes with the blood to all parts of the body,
and it has its influence on all the cells in the body. This
influence is always harmful.</p>

<div class="sidenote">(<em>3</em>) On the
body's
powers of
resistance</div>

<p>We know that when a man who is in the habit of drinking
gets pneumonia, he is far more likely to die than is one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
who is not in the habit of using alcoholic drinks. The
man who drinks cannot resist the effects of disease as
can one who does not drink. This shows that the use of
alcohol reduces our resisting powers, and puts our cells
in such condition that we cannot overcome the effects of
disease.</p>

<p>People who are sick with a slow disease like consumption
are often advised by their friends to take whisky to
brace them up. It is true that the immediate effect of the
whisky is to make the patient feel a little better, but the
final effect is to leave him in a much weaker condition
than before. More than this, the cells are much less able
to resist the disease germs than they were before the alcohol
was taken. When people are exposed to such diseases
as scarlet fever and smallpox, they may think that if they
take a drink of whisky they will not be so liable to contract
the disease. It is just the other way. The alcohol
reduces the resisting powers of the cells of the body, and
anything that does this renders a person more liable to
contract any disease to which he is exposed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">(<em>4</em>) On the
nervous
system</div>

<p>The effect of alcohol on the cells of the nervous system
is very marked. Continued use will injure the nervous
system and result in a kind of insanity called delirium
tremens. It will also cause other forms of insanity. The
effect of alcohol on the parent is passed on to the children
of the next generation, and even beyond this. A large
percentage of idiotic children are the offspring of alcoholic
parents.</p>

<div class="sidenote">(<em>5</em>) On the
morals</div>

<p>The use of alcohol numbs the sense of right and wrong.
More young men have become criminals from the use of
alcohol than from any other one cause. Anyone who reads<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
the daily papers can see that many criminals give the use
of alcohol as an excuse for having committed a crime.</p>

<div class="sidenote">(<em>6</em>) On brain
work</div>

<p>Some people will tell you that alcohol stimulates the
brain, so that one can work faster and better. This is not
true. Tests have been made in this matter, and it has been
found that men doing mental work will work about one
tenth slower and make one fourth more mistakes when
given one drink of whisky a day, than they will when not
given any whisky. If <em>one</em> drink of whisky a day thus reduces
a man's power and accuracy in doing mental work,
what do you think three drinks, or ten drinks will do?</p>

</div>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">What business
men
think of
men who
drink</div>

<p>Many business men drink, and they know the results of
alcohol not only from the effects they have observed in
others, but also from the effect they know it to have on
themselves. When a man applies to them for a position,
these business men almost invariably ask him if he drinks.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
The man who does not drink stands nine chances in ten of
securing the position, while the man who drinks stands
only one chance in ten. This shows what business men
think of the effect of alcohol, even when taken in moderate
quantities. They know that it reduces a man's power to
do mental as well as physical work, that it causes him to
make mistakes, and that it may finally destroy his morals
and result in his becoming a thief or a criminal.</p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">CHAPTER XVI</a><br /><br />

<span class="small bold">DISEASE GERMS</span></h3>


<p>We have learned that the body is made up of cells, and
that each cell is alive. The cells in our bodies cannot live
separately. There are, however, certain animals and plants
that are each made up of a single cell. These animals and
plants are called germs, and some of them cause disease.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Different
germs cause
different
diseases</div>

<p>These germs are so exceedingly small that we can see
them only with the aid of a microscope. They differ
in appearance one from another, as a pine tree differs
from an ash, or an American child from a Chinese child.
When you plant your garden, you put sweet peas in one
place and asters in another, and you know that you will
have sweet peas growing where you planted the pea seeds,
and asters growing where the aster seeds were put. So
it is with these little germs; you will no more get tuberculosis
from typhoid fever germs than you would get asters
from pea seeds.</p>

<p>Now, while there are many, many kinds of germs in the
world, there are only certain ones that cause certain diseases,
and we have learned where these germs like to live
and how to kill them. We also know that they come only
from some person or animal sick with the particular disease
which they cause. Typhoid fever germs are not given
off by a person suffering with tuberculosis, nor are diphtheria
germs given off by a typhoid fever patient, but the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
germ of each disease is given off by some person or animal
suffering from that particular disease.</p>

<div class="sidenote">How sickness
due to germs
can be
prevented</div>

<p>If we kill all the germs that come from people sick with a
certain disease, no one else can catch that disease. Knowing
this, it seems unnecessary for anyone ever to be sick with
disease that is caused by a germ. This is literally true,
and the only reason that we have germ diseases is because
we do not kill the germs that come from the sick people.</p>

<p>Professor Irving Fisher of Yale University has said, "It
is entirely possible to wipe out consumption within a
single generation." It may not actually be done so
quickly, but it is certain that the disease can finally be
wiped out, though it may require many generations to
accomplish it.</p>

<p>Why, then, are germ diseases allowed to exist? Simply
because so many people do not know the facts; and
because many who do know will not take the trouble to
kill the germs, even when they realize that some one else
may get the disease as a result of their carelessness. What
do you think of a woman who said, "I do not care if my
neighbor's children do get scarlet fever from us; she is not
a friend of mine, any way"? A woman has been heard
to make such a statement to a health officer. It is just such
people as this who spread disease.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><b>Questions.</b> 1. How may germs be compared to seeds?
2. What do we know about disease germs that will help us to
get rid of them? 3. How is it possible for us to get rid of consumption
and other germ diseases?</p>

<p><b>Remember.</b> 1. While there are many kinds of germs in the
world, only a few cause disease. 2. The germ that causes a
certain disease will cause that disease and no other. 3. It is
entirely possible to kill all the germs that cause disease.</p></div>

<span class="small bold">ENCOURAGEMENT OF DISEASE BY UNCLEANLY HABITS</span></h3>


<p>We shall not try to learn here all the ways by which it
is possible to destroy the germs of disease as they come
from sick people. But there are certain rules (we sometimes
call them fundamental
principles) that
you must know, if you
hope to keep well and
to prevent others from
getting sick.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 50%;">
<img src="images/figure040.jpg" width="250" alt="" />
<div class="cap-center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 40.</span> How diseases are frequently
transmitted to children.</div>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">Why we
should stay
away from
the sickroom</div>

<p>The first of these rules
is: <em>Do not go into the
room where any one is sick
unless it is absolutely necessary</em>.
No one but the
nurse should sleep in the
room with a sick person.
We know that certain diseases
are communicable
(catching), but it has not yet been determined whether
some others are communicable or not. It has not been
proved, for instance, that we cannot catch rheumatism from
another person. Only a few years ago it was believed that
one could not take consumption from another person, but
now we know that this is the very way to get it. Therefore,
stay away from sick people as much as possible. It is
not good for the patient to have people around him, and it
is dangerous for the well to come in contact with the sick.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Not using
things used
by the sick</div>

<p>The second rule is: <em>Do not use anything used by a sick
person until it has been washed</em>. This is a good rule to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
apply to things used by a well person also. It is neither
safe nor pleasant to eat from the spoon or fork, or to use
the napkin or towel which has been used by someone else.</p>

<p>Sometimes children think the food prepared for a sick
person is ever so much nicer than that set before themselves,
and wish they could have a little of it. How often have
we seen a sick mother give her little ones "a taste" from
the spoon with which she is eating. This is very dangerous,
and if she knew it, the mother would cut her hand off
before exposing her children to this danger.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Reason for
scalding
things used
by the sick</div>

<p>Third: <em>Everything taken from a sickroom should be
boiled before it is used again</em>. The knives, forks, and plates
should not be put with other dishes until after they have
been separately washed and boiled. Towels, napkins, bedding,
and clothing from a sickroom should not be washed
with other bedding and clothing, but should be washed
and boiled separately. Some people send out the clothes
from the sickroom with the rest of their washing, and in
this way give disease to others.</p>

<div class="sidenote">How excreta
from
the sick
should be
treated</div>

<p>Fourth: <em>All discharges (sputum, urine, bowel discharges,
and matter from sores) from any sick person should be
thoroughly disinfected before being finally disposed of</em>. The
sputum should be received on little rags or paper napkins,
and burned; and the other discharges should be disinfected
with some poison that will kill the germs. We shall say
more about disinfection when we come to study the prevention
of special diseases.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Necessity
of washing
the hands
after touching
the sick</div>

<p>Fifth: <em>Every person who touches a sick person, or handles
anything that comes from a sickroom, should immediately
wash his hands</em>. Unless he washes his hands at once,
the germs which may be on them may get into his mouth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">How dirt
causes disease</div>

<p>Sixth: <em>Dirt, which is an indirect cause of disease, must not
be allowed to accumulate</em>. If your yard were full of dirt, garbage,
and manure, it would not cause disease unless the
germs of some disease became planted there. But such a
place is an indirect cause of disease, in that it furnishes a
fine place for germs to grow in. If a fly with typhoid germs
on its feet were to alight in such a yard, the germs would be
planted in a most favorable spot and would grow very fast.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/figure041.jpg" width="600" alt="" />
<div class="cap-center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 41.</span> A place that is an indirect cause of disease, since it
furnishes a fine place for germs to grow in.</div>
</div>

<p>None of the disease germs like sunshine; neither do
they like dry places. They die very quickly in the sunlight,
and grow very slowly, if at all, in dry places; but in
damp, dark places they grow very fast. Dirty back yards
make ideal gardens for germs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>Let a fly with germs on its feet alight in a clean yard
where sunshine can reach every corner, and what chance
will the germs have to grow? They will not even get a
start. Hence, while disease cannot be caused by dirt,
disease germs stand a very good chance of living where
there is plenty of dirt and no sunshine. Filthy habits are
on an equality with filthy conditions, and go hand in hand
with them. One of the worst of habits, and a cause of
much sickness, is that of answering Nature's calls in places
other than the closet.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><b>Questions.</b> 1. Why should you never make unnecessary
visits to a sick person? 2. Why should you avoid anything
used by a sick person? 3. Why should everything taken from
a sickroom be scalded? 4. What should be done with all
discharges from a sick person? 5. How is dirt a source of
disease?</p>

<p><b>Remember.</b> 1. Unless it is necessary, do not go into a room
where anyone is sick. 2. Never sleep in a room with a sick
person. 3. Never eat from a spoon or plate that has been used
by another. 4. Boil all the articles taken from the room of a
sick person. 5. Always wash your hands after touching a sick
person or anything that comes from his room. 6. Sunshine
kills germs; let the sunshine into every corner of your house.</p></div>

<span class="small bold">FLIES AS CARRIERS OF DISEASE</span></h3>


<div class="sidenote">How germs
get into
our bodies</div>

<p>Disease germs get into our bodies in three principal
ways: they are eaten with our food; they are taken in with
the air we breathe; and they get in through breaks in our
skin, even though these breaks be very small, as when made
by the bite of a mosquito or other insect.</p>

<div class="sidenote">How germs
get into
our food:<br />
<br />
(<em>1</em>) From
the air</div>

<p>How do germs get into our food or drink? You must
remember that these germs are extremely small, so small
that many of them can be carried by a particle of dust that
you can see only in a ray of sunshine. When the germs
become dried, they float about on these particles of dust,
the dust alights on our food, which is moist and warm, and
the germs immediately begin to grow.</p>

<div class="sidenote">(<em>2</em>) From
the hands</div>

<p>Another way by which germs get on food is from the
hands through which it passes. Did you ever think how
many people handle an apple? First, the man who picks
it from the tree; then the examiner in the packing house
where apples are taken to see that they are the right kind
to be packed in a certain box. Then it is wiped off by a boy
or girl&mdash;handling number three; then it is wrapped in
paper&mdash;number four. Next it is packed in a box, but in
this case the paper protects the apple from dirty hands.
When the merchant buys the apples he feels several
of them, and puts them out on the display shelf;
this makes handling number five. Everyone who thinks
of buying apples will touch one or more of them,
and when they are sold the clerk handles them again.
In other words, every apple goes through the hands of
at least seven people before you get it. Do you not
think it needs washing?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>Go into a butcher shop and see how many people
will put their dirty fingers on the meat. Some of
them even keep their gloves on when they do this.
Imagine how many germs may be planted on the finger of
a glove.</p>

<p>Our whole method of displaying foods for sale is wrong.
The customer can see the fruits, vegetables, and meats just
as well in a glass case as when they are
on an open counter or shelf, and nothing
is gained by poking a dirty finger
into a piece of beef, or by rubbing your
hands over the apples. A glass case
not only will protect the fruits and
meats from such practices, but will
keep out germ-laden dust and flies
whose feet are covered with germs.</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 42.</span> The foot
of a fly, highly magnified.</div>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">(<em>3</em>) From
flies</div>

<p><em>Probably the most common source of
germs on food is the fly.</em> Did you ever watch a fly very
closely for a long time? Did you ever happen to see a
manure pile early in the morning and notice how many
tiny flies are on it? These flies have just been hatched.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Breeding
places of
flies</div>

<p>Flies like manure because it is the best place they can find
in which to lay their eggs. Each female fly lays about three
hundred eggs. They do not hatch directly into flies, as
hen's eggs hatch into chickens, but when the fly's eggs hatch
you find maggots, and these maggots later hatch into flies.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The journey
of the fly</div>

<p>Turn over the manure some spring morning, and you
will see it full of white specks. These specks are maggots
that will hatch into flies. Watch the flies as they leave the
manure pile and see where they go. If there is a dead dog
or cat or a filthy garbage can near, they will fly to it. Then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
they will go into the water-closet and crawl over the filth
there. Their next trip will probably bring them to the
kitchen, where they will crawl over the food. From here
they will go to the cuspidor and take a drink of water, and
will get their feet covered with the dirt that is in the cuspidor.
Next they will try a walk over the nipple of the
baby's bottle, or they will light
on your face, or get into the
butter or milk.</p>

<p>After the fly has been in dirty
places, he "washes" his face and
hands, that is, he rubs his feet
together and then rubs them
over his head. Did you ever see
a fly wash himself with water?
No, you never did.</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 43.</span> Where a fly has
walked; each little spot represents
a growth of germs left
by the fly.</div>
</div>

<p>After a fly has made his journey,
you would suppose that
his feet would be covered with
dirt and germs, and so they are. Not only does he carry
germs on his feet and body but he also eats dirty and
diseased things. Moreover, fly specks contain the germs
of disease, and the fly is not at all particular about where
he puts his specks.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Proof that
the fly is a
germ carrier</div>

<p>If you let a fly walk over a culture plate, there will be a
growth of germs wherever his feet touch. A culture plate
is simply a glass plate covered with gelatine or something
else in which these germs like to grow, and where they can
easily be seen. Each germ will multiply so fast that there
will soon be a spot of them large enough to be seen readily
with the naked eye. In the picture showing a culture plate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
over which a fly has walked (Fig. 43), the
little specks are not single germs, but each
speck represents a growth containing many
thousands of germs.</p>

<img src="images/figure044.jpg" width="125" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 44.</span> Flies go
from filth to food.</div>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">How to get
rid of the
fly:</div>

<p>How are we going to get rid of flies? We
cannot get rid of them entirely, but there
are a great many ways by which we can
prevent there being so many of them, and
whereby we may keep them out of our
houses and away from our food.</p>

<div class="sidenote">(<em>1</em>) By removal
of
manure</div>

<p>We have learned that flies are always
found about horse manure, because it
makes a good place in which to hatch their
eggs. If we could dispose of the manure,
there would be one place less for the fly to
lay her eggs. Behind barns we usually find
piles of manure. It is in these heaps that
the fly lays her eggs, not in the little lumps
found in the streets. Now, there is no
sense in keeping this great pile of manure
about any barn. In towns the manure can
be put into a box with a cover, so that the
flies cannot get at it. In the country every
well-managed farm has the barns cleaned
out every day, and it would not be much
more trouble for the farmer to throw the
manure into a wagon and take it to the
fields with him, than it is to pile it up beside
his barn. If he did this, he would find
that there would be few flies about his
house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">(<em>2</em>) By covering
garbage
cans</div>

<p>Even if we were to take every particle of manure away
as fast as possible, we should still have some flies, for when
flies do not find manure for their hatching places, they will
take the next best thing. It must be something dirty; clean
things will not answer at all for a fly's home. Next to the
manure pile, the fly likes a dirty garbage can, a dead animal,
or anything that is decomposing. If she cannot find anything
better, she will take a rotting apple; but she does not
really like this, and if she cannot find anything better than
an old apple in your yard, she will probably go elsewhere
to lay her eggs.</p>

<div class="sidenote">(<em>3</em>) By keeping
clean yards</div>

<p>We cannot entirely stop the hatching of flies, but if we
do away with the old manure piles, keep fresh manure

<p>Since we cannot get rid of all the flies, the next best
thing is to keep the few that may be left out of our houses
and away from our food. This we can do by means of wire
screens and netting. Wire screens are very cheap, and if
there are no wire screens on your house, you should persuade
your father to buy some. But a screen will not keep
flies out unless it is kept closed, so do your part by never
leaving the screen door open for a second longer than is
necessary for you to go in or out.</p>

<p>Our houses are not the only places that need
screens. Slaughterhouses, butcher shops, candy stores,
grocery stores&mdash;every place where any kind of food is
handled or sold&mdash;should be screened. Flies should
never be allowed to alight on anything which is to be
eaten.</p>

<span class="small bold">HOW DISEASE GERMS GET INTO WATER</span></h3>


<p>The water that we drink frequently contains disease
germs. It is not always the clearest water that is freest
from disease germs, for the germs do not make the water
cloudy.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

</div>

<div class="sidenote">Why sewage
should
not be
put into
streams</div>

<p>Water does not get disease germs from the ground, but
from man. Almost every town has a sewer system that
empties into some stream. This practice was started a long
time ago when men thought that running water would
purify itself in the course of a few miles. We have learned,
however, that this is not true. Germs will continue to
live in running water just as they do in any other water,
and disease germs will live in a stream from twenty-five
to thirty-five days. Estimate how far a stream will flow in
that length of time, and you will know how far disease germs
will travel in that way. No sewage should ever be allowed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
to get into a stream until the germs in the sewage have
been killed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Other
sources of
germs in
streams</div>

<p>Sewage is not the only means by which disease germs are
carried into streams. Often we find people building barns,
slaughterhouses, and mills on the banks of a stream.
The filth from barns and slaughterhouses always contains
disease germs, and often the filth of mills contains
poisons that are just as harmful as germs when taken into
our bodies. None of these things should ever be allowed
to get into a stream. Water is a very important article of
food, and we should take every care to keep it pure.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<div class="cap-center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 46.</span> A properly located well.</div>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">How germs
get into
wells</div>

<p>The water from most wells is clear and cool, but nevertheless
may contain many disease germs. "How does this
happen?" you ask. Because the well is too close to an
out-house or some other source of filth. When a man in
the country or in a small town builds a house, he immediately
thinks of digging a well just as close to the house
as he can, so that he need not carry the water far. Next he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
thinks of locating the closet, and this, too, he wants near
the house. The well and the closet are often near each
other, and often the closet is on higher ground than the
well. The vault under the closet is seldom water-tight.
In fact, the intention of the owner is that a great part of
the vault contents shall soak away.</p>

<p>In many localities the ground is an open gravel, and the
vault contents run through this gravel into the well, carrying
disease germs with them. In one little town, with wells
as a source of drinking water, the health officers found
that the closet of every house was draining directly into
its well. In some countries vaults can be used; but in any
region where there is a gravel subsoil, the contents of the
closet will find their way into the well, unless the closet is
lower than the bottom of the well. In such places the
vault must be made water-tight, in order to keep the vault
contents out of the well.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Why springs
are not
always pure</div>

<p>Springs are usually sources of pure water, but do not
think that every particle of water that oozes from the ground
is a spring. Near a certain town is a so-called "very fine
spring." This "spring" appeared after a man had made
a cesspool on the hill above, and is simply the drainage
from the cesspool. Springs that come from deep sources,
however, nearly always contain pure water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The safest
sources of
water</div>

<p>The safest source of water for domestic use is a stream
that is known to be free from contamination, or a well so
deep in the ground that it is hard for any polluting matter
to reach it. But remember that sewage may follow a well
pipe along the outside and thus reach even a deep well, if
the well is not properly protected at the top.</p>

<p>Keep disease germs out of your drinking water. You
cannot drown them out and you cannot strain them out,
so do not let them get in, for you cannot drink water containing
disease germs without running the risk of becoming
sick.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><b>Questions.</b> 1. Mention more than one way in which germs get
into streams. 2. How long may disease germs live in running
water? 3. Mention some instances showing that running
water does not purify itself. 4. How do disease germs get
into milk? 5. Describe the proper location of a well in regard
to refuse. 6. How may springs become polluted? 7. What
are the best sources of water for domestic use?</p>

<p><b>Remember.</b> 1. Disease germs get into water from dirty
places along the banks of the streams; they do not come from
the ground. 2. Clear water is not always pure; germs do not
make the water cloudy or muddy. 3. Wells often become infected
by matter from closets seeping into them; make your
closet water-tight. 4. Spring water is usually pure, but not all
water that oozes out of the ground is spring water.</p></div>

<span class="small bold">TRANSMISSION OF DISEASE THROUGH THE AIR</span></h3>


<div class="sidenote">Disease
germs in
the air</div>

<p>We take germs into our bodies with the air that we
breathe. Since we cannot stop breathing and live, we
must see to it that the air we breathe is kept pure.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 50%;">
<img src="images/figure047.jpg" width="250" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 47.</span> (a) Prevalence of germs
in air of thickly populated districts.
(b) Prevalence of germs in
air of sparsely populated districts.</div>
</div>

<p>There are always more germs in the air of places in
which people live closely crowded together than where
there are only a few people.
This is proved by Figure
47, which shows that many
more germs were found on
a culture plate exposed in
the downtown part of New
York City than on another
plate exposed far uptown,
where there are not so many
people. Remember, however,
that all germs are not disease germs.</p>

<div class="sidenote">How we
may keep
disease
germs out
of the air:</div>

<p>How do the disease germs get into the air? When
one sneezes, a spray of droplets is thrown into the
air. If the person sneezing has the grip, these droplets
contain the germs that cause grip. Whenever a person
with consumption coughs, he sprays droplets which contain
the germs that cause consumption.</p>

<div class="sidenote">(<em>1</em>) When
coughing or
sneezing</div>

<p>If a person would hold a handkerchief before his mouth
when he coughs or sneezes, these droplets of moisture
would not be sprayed into the air, and the disease germs
in them would not be scattered about. You ask, "Shall
everyone who is sick hold a handkerchief before the
mouth when sneezing or coughing?" Everyone, whether
sick or well, ought to hold a handkerchief before the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
mouth when sneezing or coughing. Learn to do this at
once, and never forget it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">(<em>2</em>) When
spitting</div>

<p>Another way by which disease germs get into the air is
from the sputum. People spit on the floor or the sidewalk,
and the sputum becomes dried; it is then blown about
as dust. The germs of disease are not killed by drying, and
when they get into our bodies with the dust which we
breathe in, they immediately begin to grow. Disease germs
get into the air chiefly through careless habits of coughing,
sneezing, and spitting, and these careless habits can easily
be prevented.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Why well
people
should not
spit on
floor or
sidewalk</div>

<p>A boy once said that if he saw a consumptive spit on the
sidewalk, he would want to hit him, and to emphasize his
remarks he spat on the floor of the room, just as you have
seen boys spit on the ground when they were thinking of
fighting. There might have been some germs of consumption
in the sputum this boy left on the floor. Of course
he was very positive that he did not have consumption, but
this was no proof that his sputum was free from the germs
of this disease.</p>

<p>Remember that it is not only the sick who should never
spit on the floor or sidewalk, but that no person should
ever spit on any floor or sidewalk, or into any place
except into a cuspidor, handkerchief, or spit-cup of some
kind. If you spit into a handkerchief, a paper napkin, or
a bit of cloth, be sure to burn it as soon as you can,
before it becomes dry.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><b>Questions.</b> 1. In what places do we find germs most abundant
in the air? 2. How do well-bred people avoid putting
disease germs into the air? 3. Why is it important for well
people to take the same precautions as sick people?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Remember.</b> 1. Every person should hold a handkerchief before
the face when coughing or sneezing. 2. Never spit except
into a cuspidor, handkerchief, spit-cup, or other special
receptacle. 3. If well people will practice clean habits, the
sick will be helped and encouraged to follow their example.
4. Remember: No spit, no consumption.</p></div>

<div class="sidenote">Some insects
that
carry disease</div>

<p>Certain diseases are given to human beings by the bites
of insects. We know that certain ticks and mosquitoes
carry certain germs. It is also probable that disease germs
are transferred from diseased
to well persons by bedbugs and
other insects that bite.</p>

<div class="sidenote">How yellow
fever is
transmitted</div>

<p>For a long time it was
thought that yellow fever was
carried through the air, but
now it has been proved that
yellow fever is not carried in
this way. A well person can
sleep with one who has yellow
fever and not catch the disease.
Yellow fever infection is carried
from a yellow fever patient to
a healthy person only by a certain mosquito. Keep this
mosquito away from the yellow fever patients and there
can be no spread of the disease.</p>

<p>It is not many years since yellow fever was one of the
most dreaded diseases in warm countries. To-day there
is not the same fear of it, for the source of the disease has
been discovered and practical methods have been devised
to get rid of the mosquito which carries it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">How malaria
is transmitted</div>

<p>Malarial fever is another disease transmitted by the
bite of a mosquito, but the mosquito that carries malarial
fever is not the same as the one that carries yellow fever.
For a long time it was supposed that malaria came from
the gases which rise from marshes. To-day it is known<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
that it is not the gases that cause
the sickness, but a mosquito
which lives and grows in the
marshes. Many countries that
have heretofore been practically
worthless on account of malarial
fever, are being made valuable
by draining the marshes and doing
away with places where mosquitoes
can hatch.</p>

<p>It might seem a very hard task
to get rid of mosquitoes in countries
where there are so many of
them; but it can be done. The
mosquito must have still water in
which to lay her eggs. In countries
where there is danger of
yellow fever or malaria, the rain
barrel and the cistern should be
screened, and the swamps and
water holes filled up. Puddles of
water should not be allowed to
form anywhere, and low places
where water might stand should be
drained. By giving her no place
in which to lay her eggs, we can
get rid of the mosquito; and when
the mosquito disappears, yellow
fever and malaria disappear also.</p>

<div class="sidenote">How wood-ticks

disease</div>

<p>In certain portions of Montana,
Washington, Idaho, Utah,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
and Wyoming, there is a peculiar disease known as
Rocky Mountain spotted (tick) fever. It is now known
that this disease is transmitted to people by the bite of a
wood-tick. Not all wood-ticks carry this fever, and for
people living in districts where this disease does not exist
there is no danger in the bite of a wood-tick; but in a
part of the country where the disease prevails, the wood-tick
should be avoided.</p>

<div class="sidenote">How disease-bearing
insects
can
be destroyed</div>

<p>All insects that are known to transmit diseases can be
destroyed. If we will do away with stagnant water, the
mosquito cannot hatch; if we will cut out underbrush and
oil the domestic animals, the wood-tick will not find a
place to grow. If we wish to get rid of disease, we must
spend money and labor; but it is worth while, for human
life is at stake.</p>

to man by the bites of mosquitoes and wood-ticks. 2. It is
possible to do away with both the mosquito and the wood-tick
almost completely, although it requires a great deal of work and
the expenditure of a large amount of money. 3. Health is the

<span class="small bold">HOW TO KEEP GERMS OUT OF WOUNDS</span></h3>


<div class="sidenote">How germs
get through
the skin</div>

<p>Germs get into our bodies through breaks in the skin.
These breaks may be made by a cut or a scratch, by the
bite of an insect, or even by the
pulling out of a hair. There
are some special germs, such as
those which cause yellow fever,
which are introduced by the
bite of an insect; but at present
we will consider only those
germs that would naturally
enter through any break in
the skin.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 40%;">
<img src="images/figure050.jpg" width="200" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 50.</span> Small, deep wounds
are very liable to become
infected.</div>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">Effect of
germs
in wounds</div>

<p>The skin of the human body
acts as an armor against certain
germs that are constantly trying
to get through it. There
are several germs of this class.
Some of them cause white pus,
or matter, but this is the least
dangerous kind of all. Another
kind causes boils or even blood
poisoning, and another kind
causes erysipelas.</p>

<p>We cannot get rid of these
germs, for they are everywhere,
to a greater or less degree; but
they are more abundant in dirty than in clean places.
They cause every degree of inflammation, from a slight
redness of the skin to the blood poisoning that brings death.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Real cause
of suppuration</div>

<p>Sometimes you will hear people say that a wound suppurated
(that is, became inflamed and full of matter) because
the blood was in bad condition. As a matter of
fact, there would have been no suppuration if germs had not
got into the wound. It was not the condition of the blood
that caused the suppuration, but the germs.</p>

<p>Sometimes, when only a few germs get into a wound, and
when the cells of the body are all in good condition and
doing their work properly, the suppuration will be very
slight, because the healthy cells of the body will kill the
germs. But if very many germs get in, even healthy body
cells cannot kill them all.</p>

<p>We have said that the germs which cause suppuration are
everywhere, so it would seem almost impossible to keep
them out of a wound. This is true in a sense; but even
after they have got into a wound, you can wash them out if
you use plenty of soap and water to cleanse the wound
thoroughly. When I said that it is impossible to keep them
out of a wound, I meant an accidental wound, for it is
quite possible to keep them out of a wound that is made
intentionally, as is done by the surgeon.</p>

<div class="sidenote">How the
surgeon
prevents
suppuration</div>

<p>Do you know how a surgeon gets ready to do an operation?
The first thing he does is to see that the room is
perfectly clean. He has the carpet taken up, the curtains
taken down, and the floor and walls washed. This
is to get rid of all the dirt and germs in the room. If you
should look at the surgeon's instruments, so clean and
bright, you would think it impossible for a germ to find a
place to live on; but the surgeon knows how closely the
germs cling, and therefore he boils all the instruments he is
going to use. Then he puts the towels into a place where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
they are made so hot by steam that all the germs on them
are killed. After everything in the room is perfectly clean,
the surgeon cleans his patient with a very stiff brush,
using plenty of soap and water which has been boiled to
kill all the germs in it. He scrubs the part where the
wound is to be made and the skin around it until it is
red. Even then he is not satisfied, for he washes it off with
alcohol and ether, to be sure that any germs that might be
sticking in the fat are removed. He scrubs his hands in
the same way. After all this is done, he can perform the
operation without fear that any of the germs which cause
suppuration will get in, for he knows that he has killed all
of them that would touch the wound.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/figure051-052.jpg" width="600" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Figs.</span> 51 and 52. Always wash the simplest cut with soap and
water; failure to do this may result in infection and much suffering.</div>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">How to
prevent
suppuration</div>

<p>Boys and girls cannot do all this before they cut their
hands or skin their shins, but they can do the next best<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
thing&mdash;they can keep their hands and the rest of their
bodies clean at all times, and thus have as few germs on
them as possible. Then, when they have cut themselves,
they can go straight to some place where there is soap and
water, and can wash the wound thoroughly. After this is
done, a clean bandage should be placed on the cut part to
prevent any other germs from getting in. If this is done
every time you cut yourself, you will probably never have
an infection&mdash;that is, a wound that suppurates.</p>

<p>Two boys were playing together one day. They ran into
each other and each got a little cut on his hand. One boy
went home at once, washed the wound, and put on a clean
bandage. He lost a little time from his play, but was soon
back and never had any trouble on account of the cut.
The other boy thought it was foolish to quit his play to take
care of such a little thing, so he tied his hand up in a dirty
handkerchief. Two weeks later he was very ill. His arm
was badly swollen and had to be cut open in several places;
indeed, he came near losing his arm. It always pays to
take care of a wound, be it never so slight.</p>

<p>Deep wounds made with small instruments, such as
small knives, nails or toy pistols, are especially dangerous,
because they are hard to clean and because they quickly
heal up on the surface and leave the germs to grow at the
bottom of the wound. Such wounds as these are dangerous
for another reason.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Where
germs of
lockjaw
grow</div>

<p>There is a germ that gets into wounds but does not cause
suppuration. It is the germ of tetanus, or lockjaw. It
lives in the ground, especially in the ground about barns,
and its peculiar feature is that it will not grow in the air.
If it gets into a large, open wound, it is easily killed, because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
it cannot grow where there is air. But when it gets into a
small, deep wound where it cannot be reached, it stays
there until the wound heals over on the surface, and then it
begins to grow. It does not make the parts swell, as the
germs of suppuration do, but quietly continues to grow,
without the wound showing any sign of infection. Finally
it develops a very severe poison that is taken up by the
blood; then the victim suddenly begins to have spasms
about the face, and finally these spasms extend to the entire
body and kill him. Whenever you get a wound so deep
that you cannot wash it thoroughly, go to a doctor and let
him clean it out with some medicine that will kill the germs
that cannot be reached by washing.</p>

<div class="sidenote">How boils
are caused</div>

<p>Sometimes the germs that cause suppuration get under
the skin at a point where a hair has been pulled out, or
even work down beside the hair itself. When this happens,
they cause suppuration under the skin, and the result
is a boil. A boil is merely an infection with the germs that
cause suppuration.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

we get rid of all the germs that cause suppuration? 3. Why is

you prevent suppuration? 6. What is the danger of cutting

<p><b>Remember.</b> 1. Germs and not "bad blood" are the cause of
suppuration. 2. Always keep as clean as possible, and immediately
wash any cut, no matter how small. 3. If you have
a deep wound, go at once to a doctor, and let him clean it out
and kill the germs that may be at the bottom of the wound.</p></div>

<span class="small bold">TRANSMISSION OF DIPHTHERIA</span></h3>


<div class="sidenote">How germs
may cause
sickness
without
entering the
body</div>

<p>Some germs that cause disease do not get into the body,
but grow upon its surface, that is, they grow on the mucous
membranes&mdash;the skin of the mouth, the throat, and the
nose. As they grow, they develop poisons that are absorbed
by the body, and that make us very sick. The
germs that cause diphtheria belong to this class.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Prevalence
of diphtheria</div>

<p>Diphtheria is one of the most common of all the preventable
diseases. It causes more deaths than any of the
other diseases that can be prevented, except tuberculosis.
The great prevalence of diphtheria is due to lack of care
on the part of those who have this disease and of those
who come in contact with them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Where the
diphtheria
germ comes
from</div>

<p>The germ that causes diphtheria always comes from
some person or animal that has diphtheria. It never
"just happens." If you went into your yard in the morning
and found some beets growing in your flower bed, you
would know positively that beet seeds had got into your
flower bed in some way. You would not say that the beets
just happened to grow there. So diphtheria will not "just
happen." Diphtheria is always caused by germs that come
from some one who has diphtheria. They may have come
in a letter that was written in the room with the sick person.
They may have come from the library in a book that
had been used by some one ill with diphtheria. They may
have come on some toy that had been played with by a
child that had the disease. There are a thousand ways by
which the germs may be brought to you without your
knowing where they come from.</p>

<div class="sidenote">How to
confine
diphtheria
germs</div>

<p>The public health officers try hard to keep these germs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
from being brought to you. In order to do this, they have
to shut away from other people those who have diphtheria
germs; that is, they make the sick ones stay at home until
they are free from the germs of the disease. We call this
<em>quarantine</em>. Quarantine means that you must stay away
from other people when you are sick with a communicable
disease, and that other people must stay away from you.
People are not put in quarantine because they are sick, but
because they are dangerous, and because we are trying to
prevent other people from getting the same disease. Do
not think the health officers unreasonable when they
tell you that you must stay at home and that no one
can come in to see you. This is done to protect other
people and to keep them from getting the same disease
that you have. If you ever have diphtheria, or any other
communicable disease, you must remember that if any
of your playmates come in to see you, they may get the
same disease.</p>

<div class="cap-center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 53.</span> Disease germs are as deadly as guns.</div>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">Seriousness
of breaking
quarantine</div>

<p>Diphtheria kills a great many children, and to play with
your friends after you have had diphtheria, and before the
health officer tells you that you may, is almost like trying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
to kill them. They might be very sick and die, or they
might be very sick and get well, or they might not be sick
at all; but you never can tell what will happen if they are
exposed to the disease. If you were to take a gun and
shoot at a friend, you might kill him, or you might shoot
his leg off, or you might not hit him at all; but you would
be trying to hit him, and it would not be your fault if you
did not. It is just the same if you play with a friend when
you have a communicable disease; you shoot the disease
germ at him, and if you do not hit him, it is not your fault.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Why
quarantine
is not raised
sooner</div>

<p>Sometimes people who have been sick with a communicable
disease feel perfectly well, but the health officer tells
them he cannot let them out of quarantine. This is because
he knows that such people still have in their bodies
the germs that cause the disease, and that as long as these
germs are there they can give the disease to other people.
It is not pleasant to have to stay in quarantine when you
feel that you are well, and children, as well as older people,
are very likely to become restless under the circumstances.
You see an illustration of such a patient in Figure 60, where
the little girl, who is under quarantine for scarlet fever, but
who is feeling quite well, is giving a book to two of her
friends. The book contains the germs that cause scarlet
fever, and the boys are very likely to contract the disease
by handling the book.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Why some
cases of
diphtheria
escape
quarantine:<br />
<br />(<em>1</em>) From
failure to
detect mild
cases</div>

<p>If every case of diphtheria were quarantined, and the
people obeyed the health officer, there would soon be
no more diphtheria. But how does it happen that every
case of diphtheria is not quarantined? Diphtheria is a
very peculiar disease. Sometimes it makes people so sick
that they die in spite of everything that can be done for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
them; sometimes it makes the throat only a little sore,
and the child seems so slightly ill that his mother says to
herself, "He is fretful," and does not call the doctor. In
the latter case the child often keeps on going to school, and
exposes other children to the disease; some of them catch
it, and become very sick or
even die. In still other cases,
the mother thinks that a child
has only a case of tonsillitis
and does not call a doctor;
the child's brothers and sisters
go to school and may carry
the germs to other children.
I have known a great many
cases of diphtheria to be spread
in this way.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 40%;">

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 54.</span> The old, insanitary
slates and sponges have gone
out of use, but many people
of to-day still follow the dangerous
habit of putting pencils
into their mouths.</div>
</div>

<p>Sometimes a dairyman
thinks that his child has nothing
more serious than tonsillitis,
and goes on selling milk.
A great many epidemics have
resulted from such cases. Sore
throats should not be treated lightly, for the most severe
forms of diphtheria may develop from germs that come
from a throat that is only slightly sore. If there is a
case of diphtheria in the town where you live, and if your
throat feels the least bit sore, have your doctor examine
it at once. If you do not wish to have your family doctor
look at your throat, go to the health officer. Had you not
rather stay at home for a week or two than see your best
friends ill or dead because of your carelessness?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">(<em>2</em>) From
diphtheria
germs in
throats that
are not sore</div>

<p>There is another peculiar thing about the germ of diphtheria.
It will often get into a throat and grow a little,
just enough to keep alive, but without making the throat
sore at all. The person in whose throat the germs are will
have no idea that they are there, but when he comes in contact
with some one who has a delicate throat, he may give
diphtheria to that person. The disease does not develop
in some throats because the body cells are all healthy and
doing their work so well that, when the diphtheria germs
try to take hold, they are driven off and not allowed to
grow. This is the reason that, before he raises the quarantine,
the careful health officer takes a "culture" from
the throat of everyone in a house where there has been
diphtheria.</p>

<div class="sidenote">How mild
cases may
be detected</div>

<p>The health officer takes a culture by wiping the throat
with a little cotton on a long stick, which he then puts down
into a long glass tube containing some substance that diphtheria
germs like to grow on. If there are any diphtheria
germs in the throat, they will soon show on this culture
material. Then the health officer will say, "No, we cannot
let you out yet, for the germs are still in your throat." No
person who has been staying in a house where there is
diphtheria should be allowed to go out until a culture proves
that his throat is free from the germs of diphtheria.</p>

<p>You see how hard it is to quarantine all cases of diphtheria,
when children are sometimes allowed even to go to
school with sore throats that are really diphtheritic. Only
two things are necessary for getting rid of diphtheria: one
is to quarantine every case, and the other, to have the
people do just what they are told when under quarantine.
This latter is just as important as the quarantine itself,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
for people often do not obey the health officer's directions.
Now let us see what are some of these directions.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 35%;">
<img src="images/figure055.jpg" width="175" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 55.</span> How pets may
become carriers of disease.</div>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">Rules of
quarantine</div>

<p>If you are the patient, the health officer will say that you
must be put in a room where there is just enough furniture
to make you comfortable, and that
no one except the nurse and the
doctor is to go into that room. He
will say that the nurse must stay in
your room all the time, or that she
must at least not go into any other
room in the house; that your meals
must be left outside your door, and
that the person who brings them
must go away before the door is
opened by the nurse. Furthermore,
as everything in the room that cannot
be boiled, or otherwise disinfected,
will have to be burned when
you are well, your pet books and
toys had better not be taken in.</p>

<p>Finally, nothing is to be carried
from the room until it has been put
into a solution that will kill the
germs, and this means not only
dishes, bedding, and clothing, but
even books and letters. The nurse
must see that all discharges from
the throat and nose are received on
little cloths, which are to be burned immediately.</p>

<div class="sidenote">How quarantine
rules
are broken</div>

<p>These are the things that the health officer will tell your
parents must be done. Now let us see what sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
happens. Your mother will want to see her little child so
much that she cannot wait until you are well, so she will
slip into your room, kiss your forehead, and hold you tight
against her. When a little later she kisses your baby
brother, and is so thankful that he is not sick too, she does
not realize that she is kissing the very same disease into his
little throat. Or, perhaps your mother is the nurse, and in
the night she hears your little brother crying; she thinks,
"Surely I can slip out and just cover him up; it will not
hurt him just for once," and she does so. What happens?
In a few days your doctor tells you that your little brother
will have to come in and stay with you.</p>

<p>Perhaps your father grows anxious to see you, and one
morning he says he cannot stand it another minute,
so he slips in for a few moments before going to business.
In a few days one of his clerks fails to come to work. Your
father sends a messenger to see what the trouble is, and
the word comes back, "He has diphtheria." Then your
father says, "What are these health officers doing that they
do not stop this thing?" He is very indignant, but it never
occurs to him that he himself has spread the disease by doing
just what he promised the health officer he would not do.</p>

<div class="sidenote">How dogs
and cats
carry disease
germs</div>

<p>The doctor told your mother not to take anything from
the room until it had been disinfected. But you do not consider
Towser, your dog, and Tabby, your cat, "anything,"
so you persuade your mother to let them come in, and you
have a good play with them. You let them rub against
your face and romp on your bed, and do everything that
pet dogs and cats like to do, and in the meantime their fur
is getting full of diphtheria germs. Then Towser and
Tabby run out-of-doors and play with the boys and girls<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
of the neighborhood. Soon the parents are wondering why
the health officers do not stop the spread of the disease.
No dog or cat should ever be permitted to come into a
house where there is a contagious disease.</p>

<p>These are not all the ways in which people disobey the
orders of the health officer and of the doctor, but these are
enough to show you that it is a very important thing to do
just what they tell you. It is not always easy to follow all
these rules, but it is far better to follow these, and many
more, than to have to think that you have caused the death
of either a friend or a stranger.</p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_XXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXIV"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">CHAPTER XXIV</a><br /><br />

<span class="small bold">THE CURE OF DIPHTHERIA</span></h3>


<div class="sidenote">Nature of
diphtheria
poison</div>

<p>The germs of diphtheria do not get into the blood through
the skin, but grow on the surface of the mucous membrane
(skin of the throat), and there produce a poison that gets
into the blood through this membrane. It is this poison
that makes you sick, and it is called a <em>toxin</em>. You already
know that when people have diphtheria, they are sometimes
very sick and sometimes only slightly sick, and that
the germ can live in some throats without causing any ill
effects whatever.</p>


<div class="sidenote">How diphtheria
toxin
is fought</div>

<p>As soon as the diphtheria germ begins to grow in a
throat, the little cells of the body begin to make a certain
substance and to pour it into the blood. This substance
we call <em>antitoxin</em>, which means opposed to the toxin in the
blood. If the little cells make the substance fast enough,
the germs will stop growing, or in some cases they never
really get started growing, because they cannot exist where
there is much antitoxin. Antitoxin looks like clear water.
The following experiment will show you something that
acts in very much the same way that antitoxin does.</p>

<p>If you take a solution of litmus that is made alkaline,
it will be very blue, like indigo; but if you drop a few drops
of lemon juice into this solution it will turn red.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Lemon
juice is acid, and is just the opposite of alkali. Now, if
you put a few drops of ammonia, which is alkali, into the
red solution, it will turn blue again. If you put a little
more lemon juice, very carefully, drop by drop, into the
blue solution, it will gradually turn lighter, until it is
entirely clear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">How antitoxin
acts</div>

<p>We will suppose that the blue is due to the toxin produced
by the diphtheria germ, and that the lemon juice
is the antitoxin produced by the cells in the body. If the
antitoxin is made fast enough, the blue disappears; but
if the toxin is made faster than the antitoxin, the blue
remains. It is the same way in the body, only it is not
litmus and acids and alkalies that we have to deal with.
If the toxin is made faster than the antitoxin, the germs
grow, and we get sicker and sicker; but if the antitoxin is
made faster than the toxin, then the germs cannot grow,
and we soon get well, or perhaps do not get sick at all.</p>

<div class="sidenote">How antitoxin
was
discovered</div>

<p>Doctors knew that this was what happened, but for a
great many years they could not discover the composition of
the antitoxin that is made in the body. One day a doctor
suggested, "If we cannot find out the chemical nature of
this thing that is made in the body, why can we not make
it in the body of some animal and then use the blood of the
animal?" And that is just what they did. They put
diphtheria germs into beef tea, and let them grow very
fast and make all the toxin they could. Then the doctors
strained the germs out by passing the beef tea through a
fine filter, in this way getting the poison, and not the germs.
Then they gave a strong, healthy horse a small quantity of
this poison; they did not feed it to him, but injected it into
his blood. Of course the horse was sick for a while, but
soon he began to get well again, for the cells in his body
immediately went to work making antitoxin.</p>

<p>When the horse was well, the doctors gave him more of
the poison; this time he was not so sick and got well even
more quickly. This treatment with toxin was repeated in
gradually increasing doses until the poison did not affect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
the horse at all. Then the doctors said, "His blood is full
of antitoxin, and we will see what it will do when injected
into some other animal." So they drew off some of the
horse's blood and took out all the little red cells, leaving
nothing but the clear fluid of the blood. They planted diphtheria
germs in a rabbit's throat, and when the rabbit
became very sick, they gave him
some of the antitoxin from the horse.
The rabbit immediately got well.
Afterward they gave some of this
antitoxin to a little boy who was
very sick with diphtheria, and he,
too, got well. Ever since then the
doctors have been saving many lives
by the use of antitoxin.</p>

number of deaths in
100 cases of diphtheria
when antitoxin is used

third, fourth, and fifth
days.</div>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">Evidences
that antitoxin
saves
lives</div>

<p>Someone may ask, "How do we
know that it is the antitoxin that
saves lives?" In just this way: before
we knew anything about antitoxin,
about half of all the people
with diphtheria died; but since we
have had antitoxin, only about
twelve die out of every hundred
who have this disease. More than this, we know that
when the antitoxin is given within the first twenty-four
hours after the patient is taken sick, there is only about
one death for every one thousand cases of diphtheria.
Do you not think that this is strong proof that antitoxin
saves lives?</p>

<div class="sidenote">How antitoxin
saves lives</div>

<p>Antitoxin saves lives not only by curing those who have
diphtheria, but by preventing others from having it. If<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
a person who has been where there is a case of diphtheria
is given a dose of antitoxin, he will not have the disease,
because his blood will contain enough antitoxin to destroy
the diphtheria toxin present. If you will watch a careful
doctor when he makes his first visit to a case of diphtheria,
you will notice that, as soon as he gets through treating the
patient, he gives all members of the family who have been
near the patient a dose of antitoxin to keep them from
getting sick.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Antitoxin
not a
poison</div>

<p>Some people may tell you that antitoxin is a poison and
should not be used. The statement that it is in itself a
poison is true. But it is also true that in your body there
are many things that would poison you if you got too much
of them. For instance, there is a gland in your throat
(the thyroid) which secretes a substance that is necessary
for your health, but if you were to take the secretion of
ten such glands it would kill you at once. Now, if the cells
in your body make antitoxin when you have diphtheria, it
is probable that antitoxin is the very thing needed. And
if you can help these cells by giving them antitoxin, ready-made,
does it not seem a reasonable thing to do? People
who give the name of poison to a substance which is known
to have saved many lives are not worthy of attention.
Anything may prove a poison if taken in excess; too much
play will prove a poison, and too much work also.</p>

<span class="small bold">HOW TYPHOID FEVER GERMS ARE CARRIED</span></h3>


<div class="sidenote">How typhoid
fever
germs get
into the
system</div>

<p>There are certain diseases, the germs of which get into
bodies through our mouths. That is, we eat or drink
them. Some of these diseases are typhoid fever, cholera,
the summer complaints of children, tuberculosis, and
diphtheria. At present we shall learn about the germ
that causes typhoid fever, how it gets into our food and
drink, and how we may prevent the disease by getting
rid of this germ.</p>

<p>Typhoid fever, like all other diseases caused by germs,
is caused by one kind of germ, and one kind only. You
cannot get typhoid fever by eating cholera germs any more
than you can get diphtheria from typhoid germs.</p>


<div class="sidenote">Animals
free from
typhoid</div>

<p>So far as we know, there is no animal except man that
has typhoid fever. Since the germs of any disease must
come from an animal suffering from that disease, and as
man is the only animal that has typhoid fever, it naturally
follows that the only way to get typhoid fever is from
some person who has the fever or has had it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">How typhoid
germs
leave the
body</div>

<p>We know that typhoid fever germs get into the body with
food, but how do they get out? Once in a great while germs
are found in the matter that the patient vomits, or spits up,
but this is a rare occurrence, so rare that we need hardly
consider it. The germs are present in the blood of the
sufferer, but other people do not get his blood on their
hands or in their food. There are two things that come from
the patient that are loaded with these germs, and these are
the urine and bowel discharges. In these two excretions
of the body are found practically all the typhoid germs that
come from the patient, and these are the causes of other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
infections. In other words, it is from these two excretions
that the germs get into food and drink.</p>

<div class="sidenote">How typhoid
germs
get into
water</div>

<p>How do the typhoid germs
get into our food? What is
done with the excretions after
they come from the body?
You will probably say that the
nurse throws them into the
sewer. Very true; but where do
they go when they are thrown
into the sewer? The sewer
must empty somewhere, and in
most instances it empties into
a stream, the water of which
is used for drinking purposes.</p>

with sewage.</div>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">The widespread
evil
due to the
sickness of
one person</div>

<p>You may think that the
germs from one person would
not make much difference, but
that is where you are mistaken.
There is a town in Pennsylvania
of about eight thousand
inhabitants, which gets its
water from a stream that flows
down from the mountains. One cold winter, while the
stream was frozen, a man living on the bank of the stream
was taken sick with typhoid fever. His nurse threw the
urine and the discharges from his bowels on the ice on the
bank of the creek. When the ice melted, the typhoid
germs in the discharges found their way to the stream
that furnished drinking water to people farther down, and
in a very short time there were over one thousand cases of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
typhoid fever in that town. Before the ice melted there
had not been a single case of typhoid, and every one of the
thousand cases came from the water into which had been
allowed to flow the discharges from one man with typhoid
fever. You see what germs from one person may do.</p>

<div class="sidenote">How long
typhoid
fever germs
live in a stream</div>

<p>Sometimes people say that a stream purifies itself every
few miles. It does purify itself of some things, but disease
germs live from twenty-five to thirty-five days in water, and
a stream flows a long way in thirty days.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The pollution
of streams
with sewage</div>

<p>Sometimes we hear people say that it is safe to put sewage
into a certain stream, because no town uses that stream for
drinking water. But of this they can never be sure. Not
long ago certain people said that the water from the river
which flowed through their town was used only by two
dairymen and a vegetable gardener, and therefore there was
no danger in running sewage into the stream. Yet the
dairymen and the gardener sold all their produce in that
very town. The townspeople never considered that the
water into which they ran their sewage was used by the
dairymen for washing their milk vessels (and perhaps for
diluting the milk), and by the gardener for washing his
lettuce and other vegetables. Thus the germs of disease
were brought directly back to the town.</p>

<p>Do not think that you are safe in polluting a stream
with sewage because no town uses the water from that
stream. The individual on the farm is entitled to protection
just as much as the individual in the town. Always
remember that when you pollute with disease the
water used by the farmer, he may bring that disease back
into the town with the produce of his farm.</p>

<p>No sewage, no matter how small the amount, should ever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
be permitted to go into a stream until all the disease germs
it contains have been killed. This can be done, though
it will cost something; but we cannot get rid of disease
germs without work, and work cannot be done without
being paid for.</p>

<p>There are other ways of scattering typhoid germs
besides running sewage into streams. Sometimes the
nurse does not throw the discharges from a typhoid
fever patient into a sewer at all, but into a closet vault.
Remember how the material from a closet vault goes
through open ground into a well, and you will understand
what happens. The germs get into the well, and the
whole family may then have typhoid fever.</p>

<p>Let us suppose that the nurse did not throw the discharges
either into the closet or into the sewer, but carelessly
threw them out on the ground behind the house, where, as
it was winter time, they froze as hard as rocks. It does not
seem to hurt typhoid germs in the least to be frozen; when
they get warm again they are as lively as ever. Let us
suppose these particular germs lay there all winter, but in
the spring when everything melted the germs were still
alive and ready to spread disease. It happened that they
did not get into the well or into the milk, but they did get
on your food, and made you ill with typhoid fever.</p>

<div class="sidenote">How flies
carry typhoid
germs</div>

<p>How did the germs get to your food? About the time that
the germs were thawed out, and were beginning to double
in number every hour or two, along came a fly and thought
that spot an attractive one for a lunch. Accordingly he
walked over this mass of filth, collecting a supply of germs
on his feet, and then came in and tracked them over your
bread and butter or other food.</p>

</div>

<div class="sidenote">How typhoid
germs
get into
milk</div>

<p>That is how you got the fever; but the trouble did not
stop with you. When you fell sick, your father thought it
was time to clean the yard, but he was not very careful
what he did with the dirt, including the typhoid fever
discharges which the nurse threw out on the snow during
the winter. There was a low place
in the barnyard and there he dumped
the dirt. One of the cows thought
this fresh pile of dirt would make
a comfortable place to lie down
in. The next morning the milkman
milked her without first washing
her sides and udder, and hundreds
of little particles of dirt, each
one loaded with germs, fell into the
milk. The milk from all the cows
was mixed together, and by the time
it got to town these germs had
grown into many thousands. Some
of the people who drank the milk became ill with
typhoid fever and wondered afterward where they had
taken this disease.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">Why the
recovered
patient is
dangerous</div>

<p>The discharges from a typhoid fever patient contain
typhoid germs not only while the disease lasts, but for
many months after the patient is well. In some cases
they are present for years after the illness is over.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The story
of the careless
nurses</div>

<p>Here is a story about typhoid fever that illustrates the
importance of washing and boiling everything that comes
from a sickroom. A few years ago there was an epidemic
of typhoid fever in a certain town. One of the hospitals
was very much crowded, and it became necessary to employ<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
several extra nurses. All the nurses knew the importance
of washing their hands after handling the patients, and the
old nurses had seen so many bad results from failure to
observe this rule that they were very careful. Three of the
new nurses, however, thought it a great deal of trouble to be
washing their hands all the time, so more and more they
neglected this important duty. The result was that all
three of these girls got typhoid fever and died. They paid
the penalty for neglecting the duty that they well knew
they should have performed.</p>

<p>Typhoid fever can be wiped out by attention to neglected
details&mdash;that is, by disinfecting discharges before
throwing them away; by disposing of excretions only in
places that are made for them; by adding lime to the
closet vault every day to kill any germs present; by making
the closet in such a way that flies cannot get into it;
and by not permitting sewage to enter any stream until all
the disease germs have been killed. All these things can be
done. It will require a little work; but had you not rather
take a little extra care than run the risk of catching or
spreading typhoid fever?</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><b>Questions.</b> 1. How do typhoid fever germs get into the body?
2. What is one source of these germs? 3. How do these germs
leave the body? 4. Name several ways by which typhoid
germs in a stream may get into foods. 5. How do flies carry typhoid
fever germs? 6. How do these germs get into milk?</p>

<p><b>Remember.</b> 1. Typhoid germs come from people who have
typhoid fever; they are found in the urine and bowel discharges.
2. No one should ever answer Nature's calls except in a place
provided for that purpose. 3. No sewage should be allowed to
go into any stream until all the germs in it have been killed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
4. Disease germs will live in running water fully as long as
they will in still water. 5. The discharges from a single person
may infect a whole city. 6. When typhoid fever germs get into
milk, they grow very rapidly; hundreds of people have been
given typhoid fever by drinking the milk from a dairy where
there was a single person sick with this disease. 7. People
who have had typhoid often carry the germs for several months
after they are well.</p></div>

<span class="small bold">HOOKWORM DISEASE AND AMOEBIC DYSENTERY</span></h3>


<p>Hookworm disease and amoebic dysentery resemble
typhoid fever in one respect, in that they, too are spread
by the improper disposal of human excreta.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Where
hookworm
disease
prevails</div>

<p>Hookworm disease is found almost exclusively in tropical
or subtropical climates. In the United States it is
rarely seen north of the Potomac and Ohio rivers.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/figure059.jpg" width="500" alt="" />
<div class="cap-center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 59.</span> A full-grown hookworm, magnified; the short line shows
the average length of the hookworm.</div>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">What the
hookworm
is</div>

<p>This disease is not caused by a germ, as is typhoid fever,
but by a worm from a quarter to half an inch long, and
about as thick as a small hairpin. These worms get into a
person's intestinal canal, and there lay their eggs, which are
later given off in the bowel discharges. When these discharges
are thrown on the ground, or are put into an open
water-closet, they may be carried about by chickens, flies,
and pigs. Then the eggs hatch in the soil and tiny hookworms
result. When human excreta are not properly disposed
of, in climates where hookworm disease prevails, the
soil becomes practically full of these little worms, and from
the soil they find their way into the bodies of the people.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">How it
enters the
body</div>

<p>There are two principal ways by which the hookworm
may enter the body. One is through the mouth, which these
worms reach in practically the same way as do typhoid
fever germs. The hookworm may enter the body through
the skin also. Some authorities state that the worm bores
its way in; but it is probable that it does not actually bore
through sound skin, but enters at some point where there
is a small break.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Where it
lives in the
body</div>

<p>After the worm gets through the skin, it is taken into
the blood and carried to the lungs, and from there it finds its
way to the throat and is swallowed. It makes no difference
whether the hookworm is swallowed or enters the
body through the skin; it finally reaches the intestinal
canal, where it then makes its home. Sometimes thousands
of these worms are found in a single person, and each one
of them entered the body through the mouth or through
the skin. The worms do not multiply in the body, and the
eggs they lay never hatch until after they have left the
body.</p>

<div class="sidenote">How it
affects the
patient</div>

<p>When the hookworm gets into the intestinal canal, it
fastens itself to the wall and sucks the blood from it, at the
same time giving off a poison that enters the blood of the
victim. The loss of blood and the effects of the poison soon
cause the person in whose body these worms are living to
become weak, pale, and thin. He is not able to do much
work, if any, and the result is that people suffering from
this disease are often called lazy. They are not lazy; they
are sick, and many of them die.</p>

<div class="sidenote">How hookworm
disease
can be
prevented</div>

<p>All this sickness and all these deaths might be prevented
simply by the proper disposal of human excreta.
No human excreta should ever be put anywhere except into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
a properly constructed sewer or properly constructed privy.
If this rule were always observed, both hookworm disease
and typhoid fever would be abolished.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">Where
amoebic
dysentery
prevails</div>

<p>Amoebic dysentery is another disease that is confined
almost entirely to tropical and subtropical climates, though
cases sometimes occur in colder regions.</p>

<div class="sidenote">How it is
spread and
how it may
be prevented</div>

<p>This disease, like typhoid fever, is caused by a germ that
leaves the body with the bowel discharges. The germ
makes its way into the body in the same way that the typhoid
germ enters; that is, it is taken in with food or
drink. The various means by which this germ gets into
our food are the same as those by which the typhoid germ
gets in; and the precautions that will prevent the spread of
typhoid fever will also prevent dysentery. Amoebic dysentery
kills a great many people in warm climates, though it
does not kill as many as does typhoid fever. If it does not
cause immediate death, it often leaves the patient very weak
and sickly for months or years.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><b>Questions.</b> 1. In what climates are hookworm disease and
amoebic dysentery commonly found? 2. In what respects do
they resemble typhoid fever? 3. How does the hookworm
enter the body? 4. Where do the hookworm eggs hatch?
5. How can hookworm disease be prevented? 6. What other
diseases can be prevented by the same precautions?</p>

<p><b>Remember.</b> 1. Typhoid fever, hookworm disease, and amoebic
dysentery are all caused by the improper disposal of human
excreta. 2. Most of the sickness that can be prevented is the
result of dirty habits; if all people would keep clean and see
that everything about them was kept clean, a great deal of sickness
would be prevented and a great many lives would be
saved.</p></div>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_XXVII" id="CHAPTER_XXVII"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">CHAPTER XXVII</a><br /><br />

<span class="small bold">HOW SCARLET FEVER IS CARRIED</span></h3>


<p>There are certain diseases that we know to be communicable
(that is, "catching"), but as yet we do not know
the germ that causes them, and therefore we cannot tell
just how they are carried about. We do know that they
are transferred from one person to another; but not being
able to locate the cause, as we can in the diseases of which
we do know the germ, we cannot explain how it is done.</p>

<div class="sidenote">How scarlet
fever is like
diphtheria</div>

<p>Among the diseases of this class we find scarlet fever.
In one respect scarlet fever acts much the same as diphtheria.
A person may have it and not be very sick, sometimes
hardly sick at all. At night a child may have a
high fever, with a slightly sore throat, and the next
morning he may feel perfectly well. The mother supposes
that the fever was due to an "upset stomach,"
thinks no more about it, and sends the child to school.
The next time the child takes a bath, he perhaps notices
that the skin peels off over some parts of the body. This
means that the high fever was due to scarlet fever, but the
breaking-out (rash) was so fine that it was not noticed. It
also means that all the children in the school have been
exposed to the disease. These very mild cases are the
most dangerous because so often they are not recognized.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Why mild
cases are
dangerous:<br />
<br />
(<em>1</em>) For the
severe cases
they cause</div>

<p>There are two things to be remembered in connection
with these mild forms of scarlet fever, as well as of every
other communicable disease. The first is that the same
cause which produces a mild form of the disease in one
child may produce its most severe form in another child.
You can contract a mild form of the disease from exposure
to a severe case; and you can contract a severe form from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
exposure to a mild case. The character of the case to
which you are exposed will give no indication of the form
the disease will assume in your body.</p>

<div class="sidenote">(<em>2</em>) For the
bad after
effects</div>

<p>The next thing to be remembered about the mild form of
scarlet fever is that, though the child may not be made
very sick at the time, there may later be very bad results.
A child who has had scarlet fever in such a mild form that
he hardly knew he was sick, may, for a while, appear to be
quite well; then suddenly he has an earache, and an
abscess forms. This abscess is due to the scarlet fever
germs which have gone from the throat to the ear, and as a
result the child may lose his hearing entirely.</p>

<p>The child may not, perhaps, have an abscess, but after
a time he may begin to lose flesh, and to grow pale. He
does not care for his meals, does not care to play, says he
is tired, and wants to lie still all the time. Finally his
mother thinks it might be a good idea to have a doctor see
him. The doctor examines his body carefully, and then
asks for a sample of his urine. When he has examined
this, he looks very serious and asks the mother when the
child was sick last, and what the disease was. Perhaps she
has forgotten all about the slight attack of fever, and the
doctor must question her very carefully before she recalls it.
At length it occurs to her, and then the doctor asks, "After
this attack of fever, did you notice that the skin came off his
hands and body?" She replies that she did, and then the
doctor tells her that the child really had scarlet fever, and,
owing to lack of care, he now has kidney disease. This is
a very serious trouble, from which he may never recover,
or, in case of recovery, he may always be weak and sickly.
Even a mild attack of scarlet fever is not to be neglected;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
it is a severe and dangerous disease in its very mildest form.
It not only kills a great many boys and girls, but it makes
delicate in health for all their lives many of those who apparently
recover.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 60%;">
<img src="images/figure060.jpg" width="300" alt="" />
<div class="cap-center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 60.</span> One of the ways by
which quarantine is broken.</div>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">How confusion
of
names
causes mild
cases to go
undetected</div>

<p>We often hear people
speak of two diseases
which they think are not
scarlet fever. These two
diseases are scarlatina and
scarlet rash. Now scarlatina
is simply the scientific
name for scarlet fever.
Some doctors will tell you
that you have scarlatina
and that it is not exactly
scarlet fever. A doctor
who says this either is
deceiving you or does not
know any better. In either
case, he ought not to be a
doctor, for he lets children be exposed to a disease that
is likely to kill many of them. It is the same with
scarlet rash. This, too, is simply another name for scarlet
fever. Changing the name does not change the disease, and
you may call it scarlet fever, scarlatina, or scarlet rash&mdash;it
makes no difference which; the disease is one and the
same.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Why quarantine
is necessary for
scarlet fever</div>

<p>Quarantine is the only way known for preventing the
spread of scarlet fever, as well as of diphtheria. If every
case of scarlet fever were quarantined, we could soon
stop this disease; but every case is not quarantined,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
because some of them are so mild that they are not
recognized.</p>

<div class="sidenote">How breaking
quarantine
shows
selfishness</div>

<p>Even when a case is quarantined, the people sometimes
neglect the instructions given, just as they do
when there is a case of diphtheria. Then there are
cases that are known to be scarlet fever but are not reported
to the health officers, because the people do not want
to be quarantined. They simply do not want to be put to
any inconvenience themselves, and although this seems a
very strange way for people to act, it happens very often.
There are many selfish people in the world; there are
even people who will not report a case of scarlet fever
because to do so might prevent their going to a party.
Selfishness is at the bottom of it.</p>

<p>It is extremely important that a child should be absolutely
free from all the little scales of skin which are thrown
off after scarlet fever, before he returns to school or mingles
again with others. If there is a discharge from the nose
or ears after the scales have disappeared from the skin,
there is still danger of spreading the disease, for these discharges
often retain the infection for many months.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><b>Questions.</b> 1. Give two reasons why mild cases of scarlet
fever should be carefully treated. 2. Why is quarantine necessary?
3. How does selfishness lead people to spread
scarlet fever? 4. When is it safe to let a scarlet fever patient
mingle with well people?</p>

<p><b>Remember.</b> 1. If you have scarlet fever and are not very
sick, do not think that you will not be dangerous to others;
severe cases sometimes come from exposure to the mildest
cases. 2. Mild cases of scarlet fever often leave very bad results,
if the patient is not cared for. 3. Be very careful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
until you are entirely well. 4. Scarlatina and scarlet rash
are nothing but scarlet fever; keep away from people who
have them. 5. Quarantine is the only way by which we can
prevent the spread of scarlet fever; there is no medicine that
will prevent it. 6. People who violate quarantine regulations
are both selfish and stupid.</p></div>

<span class="small bold">MEASLES AND WHOOPING COUGH DANGEROUS
DISEASES</span></h3>


<p>Measles is a disease in the same class as scarlet fever.
We do not know the cause, but we do know that it is communicable.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Why measles
should be
avoided</div>

<p>Measles is usually not a severe disease; that is, it does
not kill as many persons in proportion to the number of
cases as does scarlet fever. It does, however, kill more
people than most of us think; a great many little babies
die of it. How often we hear mothers say, "I wish my
children would have measles and be done with it." It
would be very convenient if they could have measles in a
mild way and "be done with it." The trouble is, that we
cannot tell whether it will take a mild form, and, worse
than this, we do not know when they will be done with it.</p>

<p>If you should go into the children's wards of a large
hospital, you would know why measles should be avoided.
There you would hear the doctors questioning the mothers
about the previous diseases of the little ones. You would
be surprised at the number who replied, "He has not
had anything but measles." Then you would hear the
question, "How long since he had the measles?" "He
was just over it when he was taken sick with this trouble."
What is "this trouble"? Follow the doctor along from
bed to bed and see the cases of pneumonia that started
when the child "was just over measles"; see how many
cases of empyema (abscess in the chest) began just after
the measles ended; how many cases of abscess in the bone,
how many cases of disease of the kidneys appeared after
the child recovered from the measles. Then go down into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
the eye and ear wards and see how many diseased eyes
and ears have followed an attack of the measles. The
children would not have had these troubles had they not
first had measles.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Necessity
of care in
measles</div>

<p>If you have measles, do not let others come near you,
and do not think that, because you do not feel very sick,
you can run about as usual. If you do not take good care of
yourself, you may have some of the diseases that so often
begin when children are getting over measles. Measles
causes more deaths than is commonly supposed, especially
among young children and very old people; and a great
many children die of diseases which they never would have
had if they had not first had the measles. Avoid people
who have measles, and if you should get the disease, do
not treat it as a slight thing, but consult your doctor at
once.</p>

smallpox
before the
discovery of
vaccination</div>

<p>Something over a hundred years ago, smallpox was one
of the most fatal diseases known. It is estimated that
during the eighteenth century it killed over 60,000,000
people.</p>

<p>Up to the time when the Spaniards invaded Mexico,
there had been no smallpox there. The Spaniards brought
the disease with them, and historians tell us that out of the
12,000,000 people living in Mexico at that time, at least
6,000,000 died from smallpox. At that time the disease
was considered fatal throughout the world; when it broke
out in a community, people fled without stopping to bury
their dead. It was a rare thing to see a person not more
or less disfigured by the marks the disease leaves on the
face and body.</p>

<p>To-day we find a very different condition. There are
now fewer fatalities from smallpox than from almost any
other communicable disease. During 1906 and 1907 only
169 deaths from smallpox were reported from all over the
United States to the Census Bureau at Washington. What
has caused this marked falling off in the fatality of the
disease?</p>

<div class="sidenote">Discovery
of vaccination</div>

<p>During the time that smallpox was killing so many
people, all the doctors were trying to find something that
would cure the disease or that would prevent it. In the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
latter part of the eighteenth century Dr. Edward Jenner,
an English physician, noticed that milkmaids did not
have smallpox as much as did people of other occupations.
He also noticed cows with little sores on their udders that
looked very much like the sores that come with smallpox.
He therefore tried making on the arms of people sores
just like those on the udders of the cows. He did this
by taking a little of the matter from the sores on the
cows and putting it into the scratches on the people's
arms. After these sores had healed, the people who
had been thus treated did not have smallpox. This
simple practice has caused one of the most deadly diseases
known to man to become one of the most easily
controlled.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Prevention
of smallpox
by vaccination:</div>

<p>Though it is well known that before the discovery of
vaccination smallpox was a fatal disease, there are still
some persons who say that vaccination has done nothing
to reduce the mortality. When you learn some of the
facts, you can judge for yourself whether or not vaccination
does prevent smallpox.</p>

<div class="sidenote">(<em>1</em>) In the
Franco-Prussian
War</div>

<p>During the Franco-Prussian War in 1870-71, the German
soldiers were all vaccinated, and only a part of the
French army was vaccinated. Smallpox broke out in the
two armies. As a result, 6,000 of the French died from
smallpox and only 278 of the Germans. In many instances,
the German and the French soldiers were confined in the
same hospitals, with exactly the same opportunities to
contract the disease. But, you might ask, if vaccination
prevents smallpox, how did it happen that there were <em>any</em>
cases among the German soldiers? In order to prevent
smallpox, vaccination must be successful; that is, it must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
"take." We will tell you about different kinds of vaccination
a little later.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/figure062.jpg" width="400" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 62.</span> In Sweden, before vaccination, smallpox caused 2,050
deaths per million population (represented by the large square). Since
the introduction of vaccination the death rate has dropped to 2 per
million population (represented by the two small squares).</div>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">(<em>2</em>) In
Sweden</div>

<p>In Sweden we find strong evidence that vaccination
prevents smallpox. Up to 1801, before vaccination was
introduced into that country, the yearly death rate from
smallpox was 2,050 out of each million of the population.
In 1801 vaccination was introduced into Sweden, but the
people were allowed to be vaccinated or not, just as they
pleased. During the ten years ending with 1811, the annual
death rate from smallpox had dropped from 2,050
per million of the population to 686 per million. Later,
vaccination was made compulsory (that is, everybody in
Sweden was obliged to be vaccinated), and in 1894 the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
death rate had dropped to only two deaths a year per million
population. Is it merely a coincidence that this great
falling off in deaths from smallpox came after vaccination
was discovered, or was it due to vaccination?</p>

<div class="sidenote">(<em>3</em>) In the
Philippine
Islands</div>

<p>Before the Philippine Islands were occupied by the
Americans, vaccination was very little practiced, and a
large percentage of the deaths in those islands was caused
by smallpox. In 1897 smallpox caused about 40,000 deaths.
A few years later the Americans enforced vaccination among
the inhabitants of the Philippines, and the result was that
in 1907 there were only 304 deaths from smallpox. There
has been practically no quarantine for smallpox and no
disinfection; the only cause of the suppression of the disease
in the Philippine Islands is vaccination&mdash;nothing else.</p>

<div class="sidenote">(<em>4</em>) In
Gloucester,
England</div>

<p>In Gloucester, England, there used to be a great many
people who did not believe in vaccination, though it is
doubtful if they themselves could have explained why they
did not. They seem to have been much like the man who,
when asked, "What do you think of this?" replied, "I
don't know anything about it, but I am against it." In
1890 Gloucester had a population of 42,000 people, most
of whom had never been vaccinated. In the latter part of
1895, smallpox broke out. Quarantine was strictly carried
out, but the disease continued to spread. As the people saw
the number of victims rapidly increasing, many of them
concluded that they had rather be vaccinated than have
smallpox, even though they did not really believe in vaccination.
By the first of April, 1896, over 36,000 people
had been vaccinated in Gloucester, and by the first of
August there was not a case of smallpox in the city. But
what had happened in the meantime? There had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
1,979 cases of smallpox; a very large amount of money had
been expended in quarantining; hundreds of persons had
been disfigured for life; and 439 lives had been lost.
And all this simply because the people did not believe in
vaccination.</p>

<p>Quarantining smallpox is a most expensive luxury,
which may possibly retard the progress of this disease, but
was never known to check an epidemic of it. Every
epidemic of smallpox during the last one hundred years
has been checked by vaccination.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Why some
diseases do
not return</div>

<p>There are certain diseases which you are not likely to
have more than once; one attack protects against another.
Why and how does one attack of a certain disease protect
against another? When a person is taken sick with one
of these diseases, the cells of his body immediately begin
to make a substance called antitoxin. We learned something
about antitoxin when we were studying diphtheria.
In diseases like scarlet fever, measles, and smallpox, in
which one attack protects against another, the antitoxin
that is formed in the body when you are sick stays there
for a long time, in some cases as long as you live. While
this antitoxin is present in the blood, the cause of the disease
cannot live in the body; hence you cannot have the
disease again. After some diseases this antitoxin seems to
disappear from the blood in a short time; after others, it
seems to remain for several years; and after still others it
remains as long as you live. After diphtheria it stays in
the blood only a short time, so that one may have diphtheria
a second time within a few years. Some people
have smallpox, measles, or scarlet fever a second time, but
with most people these diseases never return.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>If we knew how to make the cells of our bodies produce
this antitoxin and keep it stored up in the blood all the
time, we should never have any of these diseases. But in
many cases we do not know how to cause the cells to manufacture
this antitoxin. However, in one or two diseases
we do know how to persuade them to make the antitoxin,
and the one in which we know how to accomplish this best
is smallpox. This is just what is done by vaccination.</p>

<div class="sidenote">How vaccination
prevents
smallpox</div>

<p>The object of vaccination is to put the cells of the body
to work making antitoxin. To do this, it is necessary to get
some of the toxin into the body. We want to get in just
enough to make the cells work, and no more. Therefore we
make a very small scratch, and put into it some of the
vaccine which contains the toxin of smallpox. It is impossible
to have these germs in your body and not be
affected by them to some degree. If you did not feel a
little sick, the cells would not be making antitoxin, for the
thing that makes you sick is what makes the cells go to
work. But this sickness is only a matter of a day or two,
and after the cells have made the antitoxin, it will stay
in your body a long time, longer in some cases than in
others.</p>

<p>Some people, after they have once been vaccinated, can
never be successfully vaccinated again; neither can such
people ever have smallpox. Most people, however, can be
successfully vaccinated every five to seven years, and there
are a few people who will "take" if vaccinated every year
or two. These conditions indicate the length of time that
the antitoxin of smallpox will live in the bodies of these
different persons. If vaccination, properly performed, does
not take, the person is not in a condition at that time to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
catch smallpox; and if vaccination, properly performed,
does take, it is positive evidence that if this person had been
exposed to smallpox, he would have taken the disease.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Necessity of
repeated
vaccination</div>

<p>It is frequently asked, "How long will vaccination protect
against smallpox?" You can no more answer this
question than you can tell how long the antitoxin will live in
the blood of any particular person. The only safe thing to
do is to be vaccinated every few years, and if smallpox is
present in your community, get vaccinated every year until
the vaccination takes. If it takes, it shows that you were
in a condition to catch the disease; and if it does not take,
you may feel safe from smallpox for a while, at least.</p>

<span class="small bold">WHY VACCINATION SOMETIMES SEEMS A FAILURE</span></h3>


<div class="sidenote">What constitutes
a successful
vaccination</div>

<p>How does it happen that those who have been recently
vaccinated sometimes have smallpox? It is <em>successful</em>
vaccination that prevents smallpox, not recent vaccination;
there is a vast difference between the two. A <em>successful</em>
vaccination is one that results in a sore identical with the
sores of smallpox. Such a sore is secured only as a result
of the action of the germs that cause smallpox.</p>

<p>If the arm is red from the shoulder to the wrist and so
swollen that you cannot use it for weeks, it does not necessarily
mean that you have had a successful vaccination.</p>

<p>Such arms are not the result of vaccination itself, any
more than a railroad wreck is the result of the fact that
there is steam in the engine. The railroad wreck is caused
by carelessness on the part of some operator, and the badly
inflamed and swollen arm is due to lack of care or knowledge
on the part of the vaccinator or the person
vaccinated.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Some pretended
vaccinations</div>

<p>A fly blister is not a successful vaccination. Such a statement
may not seem necessary, until you hear this story.
A man showed a sore on his arm, asserting that it was a
successful vaccination. He was told that it was nothing but
the result of a blister, and not vaccination, and that the work
had been done by putting a small bit of blistering plaster
on his arm. He admitted this to be the fact, and said that
the "doctor" who did it told him that it was a new way of
vaccinating. The doctors who say that vaccination will
not prevent smallpox belong to the class who use fly blisters
and call them vaccinations. When the patient gets smallpox,
those who are opposed to vaccinations say that here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
is an illustration of their claim that vaccination will not
prevent smallpox.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 35%;">
<img src="images/figure063.jpg" width="175" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 63.</span> How vaccinated
arms are sometimes
infected.</div>
</div>

<p>Some people who honestly think they were vaccinated
have smallpox. There are sometimes instances in which a
person recently vaccinated with apparent success nevertheless
contracts smallpox; there are still other cases in which
the disease develops after a vaccination
that would not take. Here
is an example:</p>

<p>A doctor vaccinates a child in
the usual manner. At the end of
four or five days, the dressing is
taken from the arm, and the only
thing to be seen is a little black
scab. The child scratches this off.
In a few days the spot becomes
red and a small abscess forms, resembling
a smallpox sore. Naturally,
this is taken for a completely
successful vaccination, but it is not
really so. When the child scratched
off the scab, the vaccination wound was nearly healed, and
the little abscess was caused by some very mild pus germs,
which were under the finger nails with which he scratched
the wound. The abscess was in no wise connected with
the vaccination, but was simply such an infection as a child
might get at any time that he scratched his arm. No one
has ever claimed that such an abscess will prevent smallpox
any more than that a boil will prevent it.</p>

<p><em>A successful vaccination will prevent smallpox.</em> The
length of time for which it will prevent the disease varies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
in different individuals. Some it will protect only for a
year or two, while in others it will last through life.</p>

<p>Dr. H. W. Bond, Health Commissioner of St. Louis,
Missouri, states:</p>

<p>"The experience of this department, based on the observation
of thousands of cases, is that a well-pitted mark
gives at least ten years' immunity. We have never seen a
case of smallpox in a person with a well-pitted scar less
than ten years old&mdash;that is, the scar less than ten years
old."</p>

<div class="sidenote">A sore arm
not always
due to successful
vaccination</div>

<p>One of the strongest objections made against vaccination
is that the arm sometimes becomes very sore from it. This
is true, but the sore arm is not a common occurrence and is
never caused by vaccination properly performed. There is
always some cause for the bad arm besides the vaccination.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Cause of
sore arms</div>

<p>The usual cause of a bad arm is improper vaccination;
this means the lack of proper precautions on the part of
the person who does the vaccinating. Years ago, before
vaccination was performed with the great care which is
given it to-day, bad arms could not be prevented; but
to-day the cause of the trouble is not the vaccine, but the
vaccinator. Sometimes a father thinks he will save a dollar
by vaccinating his child himself, and he is likely to injure
the child by attempting to vaccinate him without taking
antiseptic precautions. The same surgical preparations
must be made for a vaccination as for an operation. If
this is not done, a bad arm will result, not because of the
vaccination, but because of the negligence of the vaccinator.</p>

<p>Never allow any person, doctor or otherwise, to vaccinate
you until the skin surface has been well washed with soap
and water, rinsed clean, and wiped off with alcohol. See<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
that the vaccine is fresh and has been properly kept. When
it begins to "take," keep the spot absolutely clean and
covered with a clean cloth, renewed daily. <em>Never scratch
or rub it.</em> These precautions will prevent the dreaded soreness
of the arm.</p>

<div class="sidenote">How people
themselves
infect their
arms with
pus germs</div>

<p>The person operated on is himself often responsible for
the bad arm. A careful doctor will put a dressing on the
arm, after he has supplied the vaccine, and will tell you to
let that dressing alone, for he wishes to take it off himself.
About the third or fourth day after the vaccination, your
arm begins to itch. Possibly you have forgotten what
the doctor told you; at any rate, you pay no attention to
directions and take the dressing off to scratch the arm.
When you scratch the wound, you introduce pus germs into
it, and you have no reason to expect anything but a sore
arm. In this case, it is not the fault of the vaccinator or of
the vaccination; it is your own fault. Never touch a vaccination
sore; in fact, it is dangerous to touch any sore.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><b>Questions.</b> 1. How is a successful vaccination determined?
2. What are some pretended vaccinations? 3. Mention some
of the things that cause bad arms after vaccination.</p>

<p><b>Remember.</b> 1. A successful vaccination causes a sore identical
with the sores that result from smallpox. 2. A fly blister
is not a vaccination in any sense of the word. 3. A very sore
arm does not result from a properly performed vaccination, but
from carelessness on the part of the vaccinator or the person
vaccinated.</p></div>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_XXXI" id="CHAPTER_XXXI"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">CHAPTER XXXI</a><br /><br />

<span class="small bold">CONSUMPTION, THE GREAT WHITE PLAGUE</span></h3>


<p>Tuberculosis, or consumption, has been known for many
centuries. It was known long before Rome was ever heard
of. Hippocrates, a Greek physician, studied it, and said
that if it were treated in its early stages, it could be cured.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">Why consumption
is
called the
Great White
Plague</div>

<p>Tuberculosis is called the Great White Plague. It is
called the Great Plague, because it kills more people than
does any other one disease; the White Plague, because
people who suffer from it become so pale and white.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Consumption
more
destructive
than war</div>

<p>It is estimated that nearly 200,000 people die from tuberculosis
every year in the United States. This means that
in this country there is one death from consumption every
two minutes and thirty-six seconds. Is it not fearful to think
of nearly 200,000 people dying every year, in the United
States alone, from a disease that we know can be prevented?
Do you not think that we ought to do everything
we can to prevent this disease from spreading?</p>

<p>During the Civil War 205,070 soldiers were killed in both
armies. This war lasted four years. During the same
length of time there were 640,000 deaths from tuberculosis
in the United States. This means that consumption killed
over three times as many people as were killed during the
same length of time in the Civil War. In some parts of the
country one out of every seven deaths is caused by this
disease, but the average throughout the country is one
death out of every ten.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 30%;">
<img src="images/figure064.jpg" width="150" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 64.</span> Comparing
640,000 deaths
from tuberculosis
the United States
during four years
with the 205,070
deaths in the Civil
War.</div>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">Prevalence
of tuberculosis</div>

<p>There are more than 700,000 people sick from tuberculosis
every year in the United States alone. Of this number
nearly 200,000 die every year. Tuberculosis is a disease
that can be prevented. It may take a long time to get rid of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
it, but it can be abolished. When you think of all the
people that are sick from tuberculosis, and of all those
who die from it every year, you will surely
want to do all you can to help prevent
this suffering and death.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Tuberculosis
a disease
of various
parts of the
body:</div>

<p>When people speak of consumption
they usually mean tuberculosis of the
lungs; but tuberculosis is not confined
to the lungs. The germs that cause
tuberculosis may attack any part of the
body, and from one part may go to
other parts, setting up a growth wherever
they go.</p>

<div class="sidenote">(<em>1</em>) Of the
throat</div>

<p>Tuberculosis of the throat is a common
form of the disease. When the
germs of tuberculosis settle in the
throat, they destroy the tissues very
rapidly and, as a rule, kill the patient
much more quickly than they do when
they start in the lungs.</p>

<div class="sidenote">(<em>2</em>) Of the
joints</div>

<p>Another frequent form of tuberculosis
in occurs in the knee; this is popularly
called "white swelling." It quickly destroys
the knee joint and results in a stiff
leg. The growth may stop there, but
more often it extends from the knee to
other parts of the body.</p>

<p>Often we see a little boy or girl wearing one shoe with a
sole much thicker than the other. This is because one leg
is shorter than the other, and we notice that the shortened
leg is deformed as well. This condition sometimes results<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
from an injury, but it is far more likely to be caused by
tuberculosis of the hip joint.</p>

<div class="sidenote">(<em>3</em>) Of the
spine</div>

<p>Again we see boys and girls with diseases of the spine,
so that they have "hunch backs" or are twisted to one side.
These conditions result from tuberculosis of the bones of the
spine.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/figure065.jpg" width="600" alt="" />
<div class="cap-center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 65.</span> One of the effects of tuberculosis.</div>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">(<em>4</em>) Of the
glands</div>

<p>Sometimes we see children and grown people with swellings
on their necks. These swellings may look smooth, but
they feel as if they were made up of little bunches of grapes
or plums under the skin. They are almost always due to
the growth of the germs that cause tuberculosis of the little
glands of the neck.</p>

<div class="sidenote">(<em>5</em>) Of the
stomach</div>

<p>Any one of the other glands of the body is just as liable to
become affected by tuberculosis as are the glands of the
neck. Tuberculosis of the stomach or bowels is not at all
uncommon.</p>

<p>The germs of tuberculosis are likely to attack any of the
tissues of the body, especially if the cells composing these
tissues are for any reason weakened so that they cannot do
the work required of them. When the tuberculosis germs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
grow in tissues, the tissues finally break down and an abscess
forms. A tubercular abscess is sometimes called a
"cold abscess."</p>

<p>All such abscesses finally break and an open sore results.
The matter that comes from the open sore and from the abscess
when it is first opened is full of the germs that cause
tuberculosis. If this matter is allowed to become dry, the
germs are blown about in the dust. Then other people may
inhale them or take them into their bodies through the
mouth or skin and thus contract consumption.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The old
belief that
consumption
is inherited</div>

<p>Until a few years ago it was generally believed that consumption
was inherited. That is, it was thought that
children whose father or mother had consumption were
born with the disease. Even to-day many people hold to this
idea, because they have not studied or learned of the discoveries
made in recent years. These people still believe
that if a child's father or mother dies of tuberculosis, the
child will die of tuberculosis, too, no matter how careful he
may be or how much of a fight he may make against it.</p>

<p>It is true that many people whose parents have died of
consumption also die from this disease; but this does not
prove that they were born with consumption. It merely
shows that they had a good chance to catch the disease by
being continually with some one who had it. It is also true
that a great many people die from consumption whose
parents did not have it. If consumption is an inherited
disease, where did these people get it?</p>

<div class="sidenote">How the
germ of
tuberculosis
was
discovered</div>

<p>About thirty years ago, Dr. Robert Koch discovered
that all consumptives have in their sputum a long, slender
germ which he called the tubercle bacillus. Some of these
germs he injected into guinea pigs, and he found that they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
caused the pigs to have consumption. Then he made
many other experiments, and proved beyond question that it
is this very germ that causes tuberculosis, and that no one
has consumption unless he has this germ in his body.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Evidence
that consumption
is not inherited</div>

<p>Then the question arose, "Is the baby whose parents
have consumption born with this germ in its body?" This
question could not at first be answered; but tests were
made by taking the children of consumptive parents away
from their parents, and keeping them in homes where there
were no consumptives. It was found that these babies did
not develop the disease. From these and many other tests,
it has been proved that consumption is not inherited, and
that the reason the child of the consumptive so often has
consumption is because he lives with people having the

<div class="sidenote">Evidence
that consumption
is
a house
disease</div>

<p>Consumption seems to be confined to certain families,
and this has led many people to think that the disease is
inherited, regardless of the proof that it is not. When we
carefully study the facts in various cases, we find that the
disease is not confined to a certain family, so much as it is
to the <em>house</em> in which the family lives.</p>

<p>The record of a single house will illustrate how tuberculosis
sticks to the house rather than to the family. From
1880 to 1901, a particular house was occupied by a father,
mother, and six children, of whom four died of consumption.
From 1902 to 1903 the house was occupied by another
father and mother with eight children. They moved
away because of the great amount of sickness in the family.
At present this father and one of his children have tuberculosis.
In 1904 the house was occupied by still another
family, consisting likewise of a father, mother, and eight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
children. Now it is known that four of the children have
tuberculosis, and it is feared that three others have also
contracted the disease. In 1905 a son of the first occupant,
with his wife and two
children, returned to live
in the house. The father
of this family died of tuberculosis.
Up to 1906
the total results from this
house, scattered through
four families, were as
follows: five deaths, six
cases in people still living,
and three suspected cases.</p>

</div>

<div class="sidenote">Why consumption
is a house
disease</div>

<p>When the consumptive coughs,
he sends fine droplets
of moisture into the air.
These droplets contain the
germs that cause tuberculosis.
The moisture evaporates
and the germs are
left sticking to the floors,
the walls, the curtains,
and the furniture of the
room. When the room is swept or dusted, the germs are
stirred up with the dust and people inhale them. The
germ that causes consumption will live for a long time
in a house; you cannot see it, but it is there. Wherever
a consumptive has lived, he has left the germs of this
disease behind him.</p>

<div class="sidenote">How to
disinfect
houses</div>

<p>If a house in which a consumptive has lived is thoroughly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
disinfected, all the germs he left there will be killed. Scattering
disinfectants about a room does no good. The only
proper way to disinfect is to close the house, for if the disinfectant
is strong enough to kill the disease germs, no
human being can stay in the house while it is being
used. Disinfecting should be done by the health officer,
because he knows how much disinfectant is needed
to kill every germ in the house and how it should be
used.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Fraudulent
disinfectants</div>

<p>Sometimes you will see an advertisement saying that certain
disinfectants will kill the germs of disease but will not
affect the people. Always remember that any disinfectant
that is strong enough to kill the disease germs will also
kill human beings, and do not be fooled by such advertisements.</p>

<p><em>Never move into a house that has been previously occupied,
until the house has been disinfected.</em> Do not take it for
granted that the people who lived there before had no
communicable disease. Do not take the word of the agent
or of any one else that there has never been sickness in
the house. People sometimes have tuberculosis without
knowing it; people sometimes have tuberculosis or other
communicable diseases without telling of it.</p>

<p>It does not cost much to disinfect a house, and if the disinfection
is properly done the disease germs will be killed.
"An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure." Try
to convince your father that by having the new home disinfected
he may save not only doctor's fees, but perhaps
the lives of himself and his family.</p>

<p>There are a great many things that boys and girls can do
to help fight this disease. This "scourge" can be wiped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
out; but if the boys and girls do not help in this great work,
it will never be done.</p>

<span class="small bold">HOW CONSUMPTION IS SPREAD AND HOW PREVENTED</span></h3>


<div class="sidenote">How tuberculosis
germs leave
the body:</div>

<p>The sputum (spit) of the consumptive and the discharges
from tubercular sores contain the germs that cause tuberculosis.
Sometimes these germs are so numerous that thousands
of them would be found clinging to the point of a
needle dipped into the sputum or discharges from a patient.
When the consumptive coughs, he sends into the air many
of the germs that cause tuberculosis.</p>

<p>We cannot kill the germs while they are in the body of the
consumptive; but we can kill them after they have left the
body, by seeing that none of the sputum or discharge from
tubercular wounds or sores is allowed to become dried and
blown about as dust.</p>

<div class="sidenote">(<em>1</em>) In discharges
from sores</div>

<p>When the discharge from a tubercular sore becomes
dried and blows about with the dust, the germs are inhaled
into the lungs of other people, or fall into other sores and
cause them to become tubercular. Since this is one of the
most frequent ways by which this dread disease is spread,
you will say at once, "Why, every particle of matter from a
tubercular sore ought to be burned, so that there would be
no possibility of the germs being scattered." This of
course ought to be done, but this is not enough.</p>

<p>People sometimes have consumption and are not aware
that they have it. Others may have tubercular sores and
not know them to be such. Any sore, whether it is tubercular
or not, contains disease germs. They may not be the
germs of tuberculosis, but even the least dangerous of them
is the germ that causes pus (matter).</p>

<p>Since we are trying to get rid not only of the germs that
cause tuberculosis, but also of the germs that cause all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
communicable diseases, it would be better to say, "All
discharges from <em>any</em> sore should be burned immediately."</p>

<div class="sidenote">(<em>2</em>) In the
sputum</div>

<p>When people spit on the sidewalk or on the floor, the
sputum will of course become dry. Sometimes a lady
drags her dress through the sputum on the sidewalk or on
the floor; it sticks to her dress and she takes the germs
home with her. The sputum of the consumptive
is loaded with the germs that
cause tuberculosis, and if this sputum is
allowed to be blown about with the dust,
people will inhale it and thus get the
germs into their lungs. Certainly the
consumptive should never spit on the
sidewalk or on the floor, or in the mine,
workshop, or in any place where the
sputum may become dry and form dust. Of course he
should not fill the air about him with germs by coughing
into it; everybody knows that.</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 67.</span> A sputum
cup of waterproof
pasteboard.</div>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">Why everybody
should
be careful
about spitting
and
coughing</div>

<p>But <em>no</em> man or woman, boy or girl, should ever spit on the
floor or sidewalk. In the first place it is bad manners.
No person does this who is well brought up. In the second place,
we must remember that the consumptive does not
like to have others know that he has consumption; this
feeling is a part of the disease. If you expect the consumptive
to refrain from spitting on the floor or sidewalk,
you must help him by your example. You cannot expect
him to be the only one to hunt up a cuspidor, when you
yourself are spitting on floor or sidewalk. If you expect
the consumptive to take the precaution necessary to protect
you from this disease, you must take the same precaution
yourself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>In the matter of coughing, the same rules hold true.
If you expect the consumptive to hold a handkerchief before
his mouth when he coughs, you must
do the same.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">How to avoid
spitting on
the floor or
sidewalk:</div>

<p>Since it is not right that the consumptive
should spit on the floor or sidewalk,
it will naturally be asked, "What is the
consumptive to do with what he coughs
up?"</p>

<div class="sidenote">(<em>1</em>) By
using paper
napkins</div>

<p>At a very small cost he can buy paper
napkins and envelopes which have been
treated with paraffin to prevent moisture
going through them. If every one
with a cough or with any such trouble as catarrh, which
makes him want to spit frequently, would carry a supply
of these paper napkins and paraffin envelopes, he would
always have a suitable place in which to spit. When you
cough up anything, spit into one of these little napkins,
put the napkin into the envelope, and when you get home
burn the whole thing.</p>

<div class="cap-center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 68.</span> A pocket
cuspidor.</div>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">(<em>2</em>) By
using
pocket
cuspidors</div>

<p>There are other conveniences which can easily be carried
in the pocket, called pocket cuspidors. Some are made of
thin cardboard, treated with paraffin, and filled with
cotton to hold all the moisture of the sputum; others are
made of glass, shaped like a bottle, with a wide mouth.
Those made of cardboard should be burned as soon as
possible and the glass ones should be thoroughly washed
with boiling water.</p>

<div class="sidenote">(<em>3</em>) By having
public
cuspidors</div>

<p>In some cities cuspidors have been placed at the edge
of the sidewalk in an effort to lessen the spread of disease
caused by spitting. These cuspidors have a stream of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
water running through them constantly and are connected
with the sewer. They are so made that they cannot easily
be kicked over or upset, and they are placed on stands just
high enough to make it easy to spit into them. If properly
made, they are not unsightly. Would it not be a good thing
if your town would put such cuspidors on your streets, and
if the merchants would put them into their stores? Every
office, every workshop, every store, every railway and
street car should be provided with cuspidors.</p>

</div>

<div class="sidenote">How consumption
is spread
from the
lips:</div>

<p>We know that the substance which people cough up
when they have consumption contains the germs that cause
this disease. When they spit this matter out, many of the
germs stick to the lips. This is true not only of consumption,
but of the germs of other diseases, such as diphtheria,
measles, and scarlet fever.</p>

<div class="sidenote">(<em>1</em>) By drinking
cups</div>

<p>When there are disease germs on the lips, it is impossible
for a person to drink and not leave some of the germs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
sticking to the edge of the cup or glass. If the germs of
disease are in the mouth, every time that the person suffering
from this disease drinks from a cup, he leaves some of
the germs on the edge of it. The next person to drink
from that cup may get the germs into his mouth.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/figure071.jpg" width="600" alt="" />
<div class="cap-center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 71.</span> A sanitary drinking fountain for public places.</div>
</div>

<p>Always avoid drinking from a cup or glass from which
another person has been drinking. You can never tell
who may have disease germs in his mouth, or when you
may get them on your lips by drinking from the same cup.
Each individual should have his own cup and should never
let any one else drink from it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">(<em>2</em>) By putting
pencils
into the
mouth</div>

<p>When you put the point of your pencil into your mouth,
you will leave germs on it just as you do on the edge of a
cup when you drink. Never put your pencil into your
mouth; never use any other person's pencil; never trade
pencils.</p>

<div class="sidenote">(<em>3</em>) By the
common
bite</div>

<p>Sometimes we see a child giving his friends a bite of his
apple or candy or cake. Of course when disease germs are
in the mouth of the one who takes a bite, the germs will be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
left on the apple, candy, or cake. By no means should a
boy or girl be selfish, but if you have something to share
with your friends, break it or cut it into pieces. Never
take into your mouth anything from which another person
has taken a bite.</p>

<div class="sidenote">How tubercular
cows
cause consumption</div>

<p>Milk that comes from consumptive cows may contain the
germs that cause tuberculosis. When you drink the milk
from such cows, you take these germs into your body.
They find their way from the stomach and intestine into
the blood, and there they travel about until they find a spot
where the cells are dead or are not doing their work properly.
When they find such a place, they settle down and
begin to grow; and the first thing you know, you will have
tuberculosis in that part of your body. Sometimes the
germs do not have to go out of the stomach or intestines to
find a favorable opportunity to take hold and grow. When
this happens, we have consumption of the bowels.</p>

<p>One cannot tell by looking at milk or by tasting it
whether or not the germs of tuberculosis are present. They
do not make the milk sour; neither do they make it look
different from pure milk.</p>

<p>One cannot tell by looking at a cow whether or not she
has tuberculosis. Sometimes a cow will have tuberculosis
and yet look very healthy. There is, however, a way by
which we can tell when a cow has this disease, no matter
how healthy she may look. This is what is known as the
tuberculin test.</p>

<div class="sidenote">How to detect
tuberculosis in
a cow</div>

<p>If a little tuberculin is injected under the skin of a cow that
has tuberculosis, it will make her have a fever and
appear sick for a day or two. If she is free from tuberculosis,
it will not make her sick at all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<p>It would seem as if all people who sell milk would want
to know whether their cows have consumption so as not to
run any risk of conveying the disease to their customers.
Some of them do take this precaution, but a great many of
them do not want to go to this trouble. Sometimes you will
hear them say, "Oh, I do not believe in this tuberculin test."
They do not want to believe in it because they know that
the cows, if tested and found to have tuberculosis, will
have to be killed.</p>

<p>The reason that dairymen sell us milk from tubercular
cows is the same that makes the man with scarlet fever in
his house fail to tell the health officer about it; the same
that makes the butcher buy and sell meat from diseased
cattle; the same that makes some people absolutely regardless
of the welfare of others&mdash;it is selfishness.</p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_XXXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXXIII"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">CHAPTER XXXIII</a><br /><br />

<span class="small bold">HOW CONSUMPTION IS CURED</span></h3>


<div class="sidenote">Consumption
should be
recognized
early</div>

<p>When people first get consumption, they seldom realize
that they are seriously sick. Most of them think they
have a bad cold, or are overworked, or that they have been
staying too closely in the house. Often they will not even
see a doctor until they are so sick that the doctor cannot do
much for them.</p>

<p>When you have a slight cough that "hangs on"; when
you feel feverish every afternoon; when you are short of
breath; when you get tired very easily; when you do not
feel like eating anything except candies and cakes&mdash;then
you should think of consumption. These are not all the
signs, but they are enough to make you go at once to a
doctor.</p>

<p>A long time ago the doctor would have felt badly if he
had been obliged to tell you that you had consumption;
but now he knows that if you go to him early in the disease
and follow his directions, you will get well.</p>

<div class="sidenote">How consumption
is
cured:
(<em>1</em>) By rest</div>

<p>When the doctor finds that a person has consumption, the
first thing he orders is rest. By this he means absolute <em>rest</em>.
He does not mean that the patient can go to school or to
the office part of the day and rest the remainder of the day.
The doctor will want to watch him constantly. Then
there comes a time when he must begin to take a little exercise;
the doctor tells him just how much exercise to take,
and just what form of exercise is best for him.</p>

<div class="sidenote">(<em>2</em>) By fresh
air</div>

<p>The consumptive must have plenty of fresh air all the
time; he must be out-of-doors as much as possible. You
will wonder how the doctor expects him to be out-of-doors
when he has been told that he must have absolute rest.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
Later we will show you how one can practically be out-of-doors
and yet at the same time be in bed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">(<em>3</em>) By sunshine</div>

<p>Sunshine will kill the germs of any disease more quickly
than almost anything we know of, and a consumptive must
have all the sunshine that he can get. Of course it cannot
get into the body to kill the germs, but it strengthens the
cells of the body so much that they can fight with just that
much more energy.</p>

<div class="cap-center"><span class="smcap">Figs.</span> 72 and 73. Living outdoors in cold weather.</div>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">(<em>4</em>) By nourishing
food</div>

<p>Nothing is more important than pure food in building
up the body and in making heat and power. In consumption
the food that is stored up in the body burns itself up
very fast. The consumptive must therefore take not only
the food needed to supply the usual demands of the body,
but enough to make something extra for the disease to
burn up without drawing on the reserve fund stored in
the body. In order to do this, he will have to eat a great
deal, and what he eats must be of the kind that makes the
best building material and the most nourishing material.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
He cannot tax his stomach by eating things that are not
nourishing; all the work his stomach can do must be
devoted to the foods he really needs.</p>

<p>The weapons with which we fight consumption are rest,
good food, fresh air, and sunshine. These will do more
good than all the medicine in the world. Fresh air is not
only one of the best things for the cure of consumption, but
it is one of the best things for the prevention of consumption.
You should always breathe plenty of fresh air night
and day, and there is plenty of fresh air to be had if you
will take it.</p>

</div>

<div class="sidenote">How to have
fresh air at
home:</div>

<p>If you have only a single window in your room, try to
sleep with your head in the fresh air. It is not always easy
to arrange a room in such a way that you can have fresh
air without placing your bed in a draft, but even this
difficulty can be overcome.</p>

<div class="sidenote">(<em>1</em>) By window
tents</div>

<p>There are several devices, called window tents, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
you can buy. By the use of such a tent, your head will
be out-of-doors all the time; yet the draft cannot strike
your body, because a part of the tent fits around your
neck and cuts off the air from the rest of your body. One
of these tents is shown in Figure 74. You do not put your
head out of the window; your
head is on your pillow just as
if the tent were not there.
Your bed is placed directly in
front of the window and the tent
comes down over your pillow,
allowing your head practically
to be out-of-doors, but keeping
the cold air out of the room.
Sleeping under a window tent
is the next best thing to sleeping
out-of-doors.</p>

in a house.</div>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">(<em>2</em>) By sleeping
porches</div>

<p>Many of our modern houses
are built with sleeping porches
on which one can sleep outdoors
summer and winter. Where there is not a special
sleeping porch on the house, an ordinary porch may often
be made to serve the purpose, or a very inexpensive sleeping
porch can be added to the house.</p>

<div class="sidenote">(<em>3</em>) By tent
cots</div>

<p>Sometimes people cannot get the use of a porch of
any kind. In such cases it may be possible to put up
a tent in the yard. If the yard is very small, a tent
cot may be used. This is simply a cot with a tent on
it, which can be closed up and put away in the daytime
and set up again at night. In a large city where
the houses have no yards at all, this arrangement can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
be used by setting it up on the roof of the house. There
is almost always some way of securing fresh air at night
if we will only give a little thought to the matter.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Fresh air in
schoolrooms</div>

<p>Unfortunately, many of our school buildings are not
provided with good ventilating plants. A proper system
of ventilation furnishes at least 1200 cubic feet of fresh air
per hour for each child in each room.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The necessity
for playgrounds</div>

<p>In large cities it is often impossible to find outdoor space
in which boys and girls may play during recess.
Even this difficulty can be overcome by turning the roof
of the school building into a playground, with a high wire
netting around it.</p>

<p>Every school yard should be provided with swings, bars,
and gymnasium apparatus to encourage the children to take
plenty of exercise. Children who live in crowded towns<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
need exercise during vacation as well as during school
days, and the school yards should be open to them at all
times. A summer teacher who shows the children the
best way to exercise, has work fully as important as that of
any other teacher during the school term.</p>

<h4>BONES AND JOINTS</h4>

<div class="sidenote">The framework
of the
body</div>

<p>The framework of the body is composed of bones. There
are 206 bones (not including the teeth) in the body. The
bones of the body are divided into four classes&mdash;long bones,
short bones, flat bones, and irregular bones.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Construction
of bones</div>

<p>Regardless of their shape, all bones are composed in the
same way. Every bone has an outer and an inner portion.
The outer portion is a dense layer called <em>compact bone</em>. The
inner portion is more open, and is much weaker; this is
called <em>cancellated bone</em> (from <em>cancella</em>, a sponge). In the
smaller bones, the marrow, which is quite soft, runs through
the spongy bone; in the larger long bones, the marrow is
distinct and is enclosed by the spongy bone.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The periosteum</div>

<p>Every bone is covered by a thick, tough layer, the <em>periosteum</em>,
which has three uses. When the bone is injured by
disease or accident, the periosteum makes new bone to fill
in and repair the break. It also builds new bone on the surface
of the old as long as the body is growing. Finally, the
periosteum gives strong and firm attachment to the muscles,
which send tendons into it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Joints</div>

<p>Every bone in the body (except the hyoid bone, to which
the tongue is attached) is joined with some other bone.
Most of them join with two or more bones. In most instances
the end of a bone which joins with another is rounded off
and made very smooth, so that it can slide easily over the
other bone. There are three principal kinds of joints in the
body. They are called the <em>ball and socket</em> joint, the <em>hinge</em>
joint, and the <em>serrated</em> or <em>saw-tooth</em> joint.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<div class="cap-center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 77.</span> The skeleton.</div>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">The ball and
socket joint</div>

<p>The ball and socket joint is one that can move freely in all
directions. We see it illustrated in the joints of the shoulder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
and hip. In these joints one of the bones has a deep depression
in it, and this depression forms the <em>socket</em>. The other
bone has a rounded head that fits into the depression. We
call this rounded head the <em>ball</em>.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 45%;">
<img src="images/figure078.jpg" width="225" alt="" />
<div class="cap-center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 78.</span> The structure of a
bone.</div>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">The hinge
joint</div>

<p>The hinge joint is illustrated in
the knee and elbow joints. These
joints can move backward and
forward in one plane like a hinge,
but they cannot move in a circle
like the ball and socket joints.
You cannot swing your forearm
about on a pivot at the elbow as
you can your whole arm, nor will
the knee joint bend in every direction
as does the joint at the hip.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Serrated
joints</div>

<p>Serrated joints do not move. The
bones having serrated joints are
fitted tightly together so that they
form practically one bone. We
find this kind of joint illustrated
in the way the bones of the skull
are put together.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Ligaments</div>

<p>The joints of the body are not
held together by rivets, pins or
bolts as are the joints of a machine,
but by bands of very tough
tissue placed about a joint in such a way as to allow it
to move freely, although the bones are all the time
held firmly together. These bands are called <em>ligaments</em>.
Ligaments are much better than bolts or pegs would be,
because they stretch a little, and thus prevent the breaking
of the bones when the joint is put under a severe strain.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<div class="cap-center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 79.</span> The muscles.</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>


<h4>MUSCLES AND TENDONS</h4>

<div class="sidenote">What muscle
is</div>

<p>The lean meat of any animal is composed entirely of
muscle tissue. It is the function of the muscles to move
the body.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 50%;">
<img src="images/figure080.jpg" width="250" alt="" />
<div class="cap-center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 80.</span> The biceps muscle
contracted.</div>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">How the
muscles
work</div>

<p>The muscles are nearly all attached to the bones. They
are just long enough to let the joint straighten out when
the muscles are at rest, but
when the joint bends the
muscle contracts. When a
muscle contracts it becomes
shorter and thicker. Sometimes
it becomes very much
thicker in one place. Every
boy knows how much thicker
the arm muscle (<em>biceps</em>) becomes
when he bends his
elbow hard. He calls this
"showing his muscle."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Tendons</div>

<p>There is not room enough
on most of the bones for all
the muscles to be attached directly to them. Instead of
being thus attached directly to the bone, they end in what
we call <em>tendons</em>. These tendons are hard and strong, and
a very small tendon will lift as much without breaking as
quite a large muscle. The muscles are soft and would have
to be attached over a large area in order to secure the required
strength. The tendons, being so much stronger than the
muscles, can be attached to a very small area and yet secure
the same amount of power as would result from attaching
the muscle itself.</p>

<p>The tendons pass directly into the periosteum, the thick,
strong covering of the bones. So strong is this attachment
that the bone will often break before the tendon will pull
loose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>


<h4>THE SKIN</h4>

<div class="sidenote">The skin as
an armor</div>

<p>The entire body is covered with skin, which regulates the
heat of the body and acts as an armor against blows and cuts
which would otherwise injure the delicate nerves and blood
vessels beneath. It also serves to some extent to keep out
the germs of disease. The skin
appears to be smooth, but if you
examine it through a strong
magnifying glass you will see
that it is divided into little
areas. The dividing lines do
not run straight, however, and
the areas are not square like
those you find on a checkerboard.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 50%;">
<img src="images/figure081.jpg" width="250" alt="" />
<div class="cap-center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 81.</span> A section of the
skin, highly magnified.</div>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">Sweat
glands</div>

<p>After looking at the skin with
a strong magnifying glass you
will think that you must have
seen all its irregularities, but if
you will look at it with a powerful
microscope you will find out
many other things. In the first
place you will see many little
openings in the skin. These
little openings make the ridges
which divide the skin into little
areas. Some of the openings are
<em>sweat glands</em>, and there is always
some perspiration coming out of them. When you are very
warm you can see, without the aid of the glass, the drops of
perspiration as they come out on the surface of the skin.
When you are not very warm you cannot see these drops of
perspiration, but they are nevertheless coming out all the
time. When the perspiration comes so slowly that you
cannot see it, it is called <em>insensible perspiration</em>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Hair</div>

<p>The whole body is covered with hair. You can see the
hair on your head and some of the hair on your arms and
the backs of your hands, but most of the hair on the body
is so fine that you cannot see it without a microscope. Each
of the fine hairs on the body has a root that goes through
the skin just as the root from each hair on your head goes
through it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sebaceous
glands</div>

<p>Opening into the little pockets in which the hairs stand,
are glands that secrete a kind of oily material. They are
called <em>sebaceous glands</em> or <em>follicles</em>. Sometimes these follicles
become stopped up; then the material they secrete becomes
thick and cheesy, and the little black points appear on the
skin which we call <em>blackheads</em>. The white matter which
comes out of these blackheads is merely the secretion of the
glands from which the water has been absorbed, leaving the
solid or cheesy portion.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Nails</div>

<p>There is a part of the skin that we do not usually think of
as skin. We mean the <em>nails</em>. The finger nails and the toe
nails do not look like the rest of the skin of the body, but
they are made of just the same kind of cells. The cells of
the nails are flat, dead, and closely packed together. There
are no sweat glands, or sebaceous glands, or any hairs in
the nails.</p>


<h4>THE DIGESTIVE SYSTEM</h4>

<div class="sidenote">The alimentary
canal</div>

<p>The digestive system is the part of our bodies in which
the food we eat is so changed that it can be made use of by
the little cells in the body. It is composed of a long canal
with many parts and enlargements, each part necessary for
a certain required work. This canal as a whole is called the
<em>alimentary canal</em>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Teeth</div>

<p>The mouth does the first part of the work for the digestive
system. Here we find the teeth, which are used for
grinding the food. The teeth are composed of three parts,
the <em>head</em> (or <em>crown</em>), the <em>neck</em> and the <em>root</em>. The head, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
crown, is very hard. Each tooth is hollow, and in the hollow
portion there are nerves and blood vessels.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The salivary
glands</div>

<p>Opening into the mouth are three pairs of glands known
as <em>salivary glands</em>. One pair of glands is located just above
the angle of the jaw. It
is these glands that become
swollen when we
have mumps. Another
pair of glands is placed
just inside the jaw bone,
near the root of the
tongue, and the third
pair is located under the
tongue. These three
pairs of glands secrete the
saliva which moistens
the food and aids in
digesting the starch.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 60%;">
<img src="images/figure082.jpg" width="300" alt="" />
<div class="cap-center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 82.</span> The alimentary canal.</div>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">The
esophagus</div>

<p>The food passes from
the mouth; through a
passage called the <em>esophagus</em>,
or gullet, to the
<em>stomach</em>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The stomach</div>

<p>The stomach is one of the enlarged parts of the alimentary
canal. Its walls are quite thick, and in these walls are thousands
of little glands. These glands secrete a fluid called
<em>gastric juice</em>. When the food enters the stomach it is held
there for a long time, and the walls of the stomach squeeze
upon it so that the food is mixed with the gastric juice until
every bit of it that will be of any use to the body has become
fluid in character. Not only does the gastric juice make the
food liquid, but it acts on it and changes some of it so that
it will be suitable for use by the little cells of the body. As
fast as the food is made liquid by the juices of the stomach
it is allowed to pass into the intestine through an opening
called the <em>pyloric opening</em>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The
intestine</div>

<p>The intestine is a long, narrow, twisting and turning tube
that is divided into two principal parts, the large and small
intestine. In the walls of the intestine are many little glands
that secrete a fluid that helps in digesting the food. Two
fluids, one made by the liver, the other by the pancreas, are
brought into the intestine by two small tubes, which come
together in the wall of the intestine six or seven inches below
the pyloric opening. These fluids perform a very important
part in the digestion of all the different foodstuffs.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Villi and
lymphatics</div>

<p>Besides the little glands in the walls of the intestine there
are many thousands of little finger-like projections standing
up from the walls. These are called <em>villi</em>. Each villus has
in it very small vessels, into which the food passes after it
has been digested. These vessels are of two sorts: blood
vessels, which take up the digested starch and proteid
foods, and another sort known as <em>lymphatics</em>, which take
up the fats. All the lymphatics combine into a single
vessel which empties into the great vein at the base of
the neck. Thus the fatty foods pass into the blood and are
mingled with the food materials taken up directly by the
blood vessels.</p>


<h4>CIRCULATION OF THE BLOOD</h4>

<div class="sidenote">Two kinds
of blood
vessels</div>

<p>There are two kinds of blood vessels in the body. We
call them <em>arteries</em> and <em>veins</em>. The arteries serve to carry the
blood from the heart to all parts of the body, and the veins
serve to carry the blood back to the heart. The heart is
really a part of the blood vessels, half of each side being like
the veins and half like the arteries.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Arteries
and veins</div>

<p>The walls of the arteries are thicker than those of the
veins. Two sets of arteries leave the heart, one from each
side. The artery that starts from the right side of the heart
goes to the lungs and carries <em>venous blood</em>, which has a very
poor supply of oxygen and is full of impurities. We call this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
the <em>pulmonary artery</em>. The artery that leaves the left side
of the heart goes to all parts of the body but the lungs and
carries <em>arterial blood</em>, which has much more oxygen and is
much more free from impurities.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Capillaries</div>

<p>If we follow the blood as it circulates we will see how it
reaches all parts of the body. The big artery that leaves the
left side of the heart divides into smaller and smaller arteries
until there are branches going to every part of the body.
These branches keep dividing until they are so small that
we call them <em>arterioles</em>, and these little arterioles again divide
and become so small that we call them <em>capillaries</em>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Changes in
the blood</div>

<p>While the blood is passing through the arterioles and the
capillaries, something is happening to it. The little cells
with which these small vessels come in contact have been
taking the oxygen and the nourishing material out of the
blood. At the same time they have been putting something
into the blood. In place of the oxygen they have been putting
in carbon dioxid and in place of the nourishing material they
have been putting in the worn-out materials from the cells.
As the blood passes through certain parts of the body, such
as the kidneys, the worn-out materials from the cells are
taken out of the blood and sent out of the body. The carbon
dioxid is left in the blood until it goes to the lungs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/figure083.jpg" width="500" alt="" />
<div class="cap-center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 83.</span> The white vessels represent the circulation of the arterial
blood; the gray, the circulation of the venous blood.</div>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">Venous
blood</div>

<p>The blood has now been followed to the capillaries, where
oxygen and nourishing material have been taken out of it,
and where something else has been added to it. As we follow
a little capillary, we find that instead of dividing again, it
joins others and gradually grows larger. As these blood
vessels grow larger the walls do not become so thick as the
walls of the arteries of the same size. These larger vessels
formed by the union of capillaries are called <em>veins</em>. In other
words, the veins are simply continuations of the arteries
that have divided into extremely small branches and have
now come together again. The blood which has been changed
is now called <em>venous blood</em>. It has much less oxygen in it,
but has received a great deal of carbon dioxid. The veins<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
continue to come together, until finally they form a single
large vein which empties into the upper half of the right
side of the heart. From there the blood is driven into the
lower half of the right side of the heart and thence to the
pulmonary artery, which goes to the lungs. The blood is
not changed in the heart, so what goes into the pulmonary
artery is still venous blood.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Arterial
blood</div>

<p>The blood goes straight from the heart to the lungs and
there it is changed into arterial blood. The change consists
in taking oxygen from the air and giving off carbon dioxid
to the air. From the lungs the blood goes through the capillaries
again into the veins, the small capillaries in the lungs
uniting to form the pulmonary veins. These veins finally
unite into one vein that empties into the upper half of the
left side of the heart, and from there the blood goes to the
lower half of the same side. The blood has now reached its
starting point and is ready to begin its journey again. The
journey of the blood is as follows:</p>

<div class="sidenote">Entire
circulation</div>

<p>From the right side of the heart to the arteries; from
arteries into arterioles; from arterioles to capillaries; from
capillaries into veins; from veins into the heart; from the
heart to the lungs; and from the lungs back to the heart
again.</p>


<h4>THE RESPIRATORY SYSTEM</h4>

<div class="sidenote">Use of the
respiratory
system</div>

<p>That portion of the body by which we breathe is called
the respiratory system. This system is composed of the
<em>nasal passage</em>, the <em>pharynx</em>, the <em>larynx</em>, the <em>trachea</em>, the <em>bronchi</em>,
and the <em>lungs</em>. The mouth is not a part of the respiratory
system; we should never breathe through our mouths.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The use of
the nose in
breathing</div>

<p>As the air passes through the nasal passage it is warmed
and moistened, and a great deal of dust and dirt is taken out
of it. Thus the nasal passage serves to warm, to moisten,
and to clean the air we breathe, and is a very important part
of the respiratory system, since either cold or dry air is very
irritating to the lungs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 50%;">
<img src="images/figure084.jpg" width="250" alt="" />
<div class="cap-center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 84.</span> The air passages of the
head and throat.</div>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">Pharynx,
larynx, and
trachea</div>

<p>There is only one tube leading from the back of the nasal
passage to the lungs. Different parts of this tube are given
different names. The pharynx is that part that extends
from the back of the nose
to the vocal chords. The
larynx is the part of the
throat where the vocal
chords are located. We
sometimes call it the "Adam's
apple." It is very
prominent in some men,
but seldom noticeable in
women. The trachea is
the part of the tube leading
down from the larynx.
At the lower end of the
trachea the tube divides
into two parts that we
call the bronchi, one leading
to each lung.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The bronchi</div>

<p>The bronchi carry the
air from the trachea to
the lungs. They divide
again and again until they
become so small that
there is a branch for each
little air cell in the lungs.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/figure085.jpg" width="450" alt="" />
<div class="cap-center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 85.</span> The lungs.</div>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">The lungs</div>

<p>The lungs are the most important part of the respiratory
system. They are made up of lobes. There are two lobes
in the left lung and three in the right. Each lobe is divided
into <em>lobules</em>, which means small lobes. Each lobule is divided
into air spaces. In these air spaces, or cells, the work of the
lungs is performed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Air cells</div>

<p>The capillaries run in the thin walls of the air spaces.
The walls of these fine blood vessels are so very thin that
the air in the air cells comes in almost direct contact with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
blood in the vessels. While the blood is passing through the
vessels in the walls of the air spaces, something happens to
both the blood and the air. The air we take into our lungs
contains a great deal of oxygen and very little carbon dioxid.
The air that comes out of our lungs contains a great deal of
carbon dioxid and much less oxygen. In other words, the
oxygen from the air goes into the blood, and the carbon
dioxid from the blood goes out into the air.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Necessity of
pure air</div>

<p>If the air we breathe is not pure and does not contain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
enough oxygen, the blood cannot get all the oxygen we need,
and the cells of the body become sick and die. If, when we
breathe, we do not fill each little air cell in our lungs with
air, a great deal of the blood sent to the lungs for oxygen
cannot get it. If we wear very tight clothing we cannot take
a full breath and hence cannot fill all the air spaces with air.
If the air spaces in the lungs are not filled, the blood does not
get the oxygen it needs, as there is no other place in the body
to get it.</p>


<h4>THE EYE AND THE EAR</h4>

<div class="sidenotex">The eye
compared
to a camera</div>

<p>The eye is one of the most important organs in the body
and also one of the most delicate. It is very much like a
camera.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The cornea
and the
sclera</div>

<p>When you look at an eye you are likely to think that the
front of it is blue or brown. The colored part is not the front
of the eye. If you look at the eye from the side you will
see that there is a curved part in front of the colored part
and that the curved part is perfectly clear. This curved
clear part of the eye we call the <em>cornea</em>. The cornea connects
with the white part of the eye, and this white part extends
all around the rest of the eye, except at a small point in the
back where the <em>optic nerve</em> comes through. This white part
we call the <em>sclera</em>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Aqueous
humor</div>

<p>The space between the cornea and the colored part of the
eye is filled with a clear fluid that is called the <em>aqueous humor</em>,
which means watery fluid. The space occupied by this fluid
is called the <em>anterior chamber</em> of the eye.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The iris</div>

<p>The iris, which is the colored portion of the eye, is a curtain
that is hung between the anterior and posterior chambers
of the eye. It prevents any light getting into the posterior
chamber except that which passes through a round hole in
the iris called the <em>pupil</em>. The pupil grows larger or smaller
according to the amount of light needed by the eye. If you
look away from a bright light at something in the dark, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
pupil grows larger; if you look back at the light, it grows
smaller. You can see this in a hand mirror.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Lens</div>

<p>Behind the pupil is a clear mass shaped like a very strong
magnifying glass. This is the <em>lens</em>. The lens causes to be
formed on the back of the eye a clear picture of whatever
you are looking at. When you focus a camera, you move
the back towards or away from the lens. When you focus
your eye you cannot move the back of the eye, but you can
make the lens more or less
convex as may be needed to
make a clear picture.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Vitreous
humor</div>

<p>Behind the iris and the
lens, we find the posterior
chamber of the eye. This
occupies by far the greater
portion of the ball and corresponds
to the dark chamber
of a camera. This
chamber is filled with a
clear fluid called the <em>vitreous
humor</em>, which means
jelly-like fluid. It is a clear, gelatinous substance.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The retina
and the optic
nerve</div>

<p>The optic nerve enters the eyeball from the back and
spreads its fibers out in a thin membrane called the <em>retina</em>,
which corresponds to the sensitive plate in a camera. The
lens focuses on the retina the image of any object you look
at. The impression made on the minute nerve endings in
the retina is carried by the optic nerve fibers to the brain.
When this impression reaches the brain we see the object.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Movements
of the eye</div>

<p>Each eye has six muscles that turn it in whatever direction
you want to look. These muscles are very delicate, and for
true sight they must be exactly adjusted. If the muscles on
one side of the eye are stronger than those on the other side,
you will be cross-eyed or wall-eyed. If one of the muscles in
one eye is stronger than the corresponding muscle in the other
eye, it pulls the eyeball out of place and you "see double."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The use of
the outer ear</div>

<p>The portion of the ear that you see on the side of your
head has as much to do with hearing as the outer rim of
the horn into which you speak has to do with making a
record for the phonograph. You know that the record is
really made at the little end of the horn, while the big end
simply collects the sound. The outside portion of the ear
simply collects sounds, and the real hearing is done with the
portion of the ear that is not seen.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/figure087.jpg" width="600" alt="" />
<div class="cap-center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 87.</span> The ear, showing the outer, middle, and the inner part.</div>
</div>

<p>The outer ear connects with the short tube that leads to
the <em>drum</em>, which is a thin membrane that separates the
middle ear from the outer ear. This drum does not have
so much to do with hearing as is supposed. To have a hole
in the drum does not mean that you cannot hear.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The middle
ear</div>

<p>The middle ear is that portion which is just inside the
drum. In this we find a chain of little bones. The one
attached to the drum is shaped much like a hammer, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
is called the <em>malleus</em>, which means mallet or hammer. The
next one is shaped like an anvil and is called <em>incus</em>, which
means anvil, and the third is called <em>stapes</em>, which means
stirrup. The flat part of the stapes fits into a small opening
that leads to the internal ear.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The inner
ear</div>

<p>The internal ear is shaped like a snail shell. It makes
several turns, which are hollow like the ends of a conch shell.
In these channels the nerve that receives the impressions
made by the sounds is distributed. This nerve carries the
impressions to the brain.</p>

<h4>THE NERVOUS SYSTEM</h4>

<div class="sidenote">Importance
of the
nervous
system</div>

<p>This system is so important in its use and so difficult to
understand in its details, that a description of it should have
more space than can be given in this summary. Can you
imagine having no feeling and being unable to move? This
would be your condition if you had no nerves.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Nerves compared
to
telegraph
system</div>

<p>Briefly, the nerves might be called the telegraph system of
the body. There is a great central station called the brain
where messages are received and sent out; there are many
sub-stations that make up the spinal cord. Twelve great
nerves pass directly from the brain to the body; all others
pass from the spinal cord.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Extent of
nervous
system</div>

<p>Every nerve leaving these centres divides and sub-divides
into little threads as the arteries divide and sub-divide into
arterioles and capillaries, until every part of the body&mdash;every
muscle and part of the skin&mdash;has its nerve.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Voluntary
and reflex
action</div>

<p>Every time you <em>choose</em> to move your hand, your brain sends
to the necessary muscles an instantaneous order to act. This
is called <em>voluntary action</em>. If you put your finger against a hot
stove you jerk it away before you could have time to <em>choose</em>
to do it. This happens as an order from a sub-station and
is called <em>reflex action</em>.</p>

<p>Messages travel both ways and it is necessary that the nervous
connection with every part of the body remain unbroken,
and important that the nervous condition be kept healthy.</p>

<h3><a name="SUGGESTIONS" id="SUGGESTIONS"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">NOTES TO THE TEACHER</a></h3>


<div class="appendix">

<p>A false delicacy has often prevented the teaching of vital
lessons to growing children. The day is how at hand when
foolish sentiment must no longer prevent the spread of any
knowledge which is necessary to exterminate the plagues
that have afflicted the race.</p>

<p>In chapters 17, 18, 19 and 32, unpleasant facts are given
in plain language. They are facts that parents do not
teach their children and that most teachers will not frankly
treat with classes in a school. Though they are disagreeable
to discuss, they are essential for children of school
age to know. Now that the dependence of public health
upon personal hygiene is recognized, personal habits and
sanitary conditions are more frankly dealt with than
formerly.</p>

<p>It is an excellent thing occasionally, to have one or two
points of an assigned lesson answered in writing. Any
topic that the teacher may think advisable to treat in this
manner may be discussed on paper at the beginning of
the recitation, five or six minutes being allowed for that
purpose. Even a whole chapter may be assigned to be
studied with a view of answering in writing the questions at
the end of the chapter. The written test can then take the
place of the usual oral recitation. This method is suggested
to the teacher who hesitates to discuss orally certain
plain but essential facts.</p>

<p>Chapter 32 on the Spread and Prevention of Consumption
can be treated with best results orally, if the pupils are
first made to <em>feel</em> the great danger of consumption and to
realize the possibility of preventing the vast havoc wrought
by that dread disease. The attitude of teacher and pupils
should be that while the discussion may be disagreeable, the
disgusting habits referred to in the text are so commonly
practised that unless their dangers are taught this disease
can never be wiped out.</p>

it is a good plan to put the box on skids, and have a heavy strip in

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org/license

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
